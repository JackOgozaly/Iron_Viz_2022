Frank Lloyd Wright,American System-Built Houses for The Richards Company project (Exterior perspective of model D101),"""You Can Own an American Home,"" trumpeted a 1917 Chicago newspaper's full-page advertisement for Frank Lloyd Wright's new ""System-Built Houses""-low-cost houses assembled from factory-produced elements. Customers requesting plans and brochures from the Richards Company would have received prints like these illustrating the many house models from which they could have chosen. Modeled on Japanese woodblock prints, the style of Wright's lithographs evinces his life-long love of Japanese art. The high horizon line, the planar flatness of foreground and sky, the silhouetted foliage, and the red square (or ""chop"") framed by the text-all suggest a studied japonisme. Most likely the originals were prepared by Antonin Raymond, Wright's assistant on the contemporary Imperial Hotel project in Tokyo.
The System-Built Houses were Wright's first experiment with mass production. Like many modern architects, he confronted both the benefits of the rationalized standardization associated with machine production and the desire for individual expression. ""Individuality is a national ideal"", Wright proclaimed in 1910, and for him this ideal was symbolized by the American house. Thus he developed a system that allowed variety within an overall unity. Regardless of house size and plan, most of the details were ""conventionalized"", a term Wright applied to a principle of abstracting form to its essentials. The houses were constructed of wood framing, floors, joists, rafters, roofs, and trim. To streamline the construction process, lumber was measured and precut in the Richards Company factory, then shipped to the site where it was to be assembled, thus saving the contractor and the customer time and money.
Wright liked to give his houses descriptive names, for example La Miniatura (pp. 62-63), but the System-Built Houses bear perfunctory labels, such as D101. There were dozens of models, ranging from one to three stories, and the isometric plans illustrate numerous room configurations as well as ideas on how to furnish them. The designs recall Wright's earlier Prairie Houses, named for the landscape of his native Midwest. The characteristic low cantilevered roofs, the linear wood trim visually unifying the stucco wall planes, and the geometric decoration of the art-glass windows constitute a compelling modern alternative to the typical suburban bungalow. An untold number of System-Built Houses were built, mostly in the Midwest. In the following decades Wright continued to experiment with a range of materials and construction systems in an effort to reduce the expense of house building and to give industrialized methods character, expression, and personality.

Ludwig Mies van der Rohe,"Resor House project, Jackson Hole, Wyoming (Interior perspective of living room and south glass wall)","This commission for a vacation house near Jackson Hole, Wyoming, in the Grand Teton Mountains, brought Mies van der Rohe to the United States for the first time, in 1937. These photocollages are a departure from the architect’s earlier photomontages. Instead of a composite image composed by cut–and–pasting different photographs, the photographic content is presented in dialogue with an architectural sketch. Rather than an external, urban scene, the nearly dematerialized architecture of the interior stages a view onto the surrounding landscape. The design is limited to spare horizontal lines that indicate the planes of floor and ceiling and slender cruciform columns that span between them. The overscaled and vividly textured landscape imagery was taken from film posters and magazines. It acts both as a visual extension of the architecture and an illusionistic space that distorts and rearranges the linear perspective of the drawing.

In 1937, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe accepted an invitation to visit the United States for the purpose of designing a vacation home for Mr. and Mrs. Stanley Resor near Jackson Hole, Wyoming. The house was to span a stream that branched off the Snake River; the Grand Tetons loomed in the distance. By the next year Mies had emigrated to the United States to head the architecture school at the Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago. Although the clients had lost interest in pursuing the project, Mies continued to revise the design and created a number of new drawings, including this collage. George Danforth and William Priestley, students of Mies's, produced the collage, which represents a view from the main living area to the landscape beyond.
In preparing his original design, Mies had made sketches showing freestanding elements—a bench facing the view, a long low cabinet defining the dining space, and a taller bookcase creating a reading area. The strip of wood veneer in the collage seems to be a vestige of the cabinet while the cutout of a painting (Paul Klee's Gay Repast, 1928) reflects the proportions of the bookcase. The disposition of these elements appears neither functional nor even literal, but rather suggests the flowing nature of the space Mies envisaged.
Mies had used collage as a presentation technique throughout his career, beginning with the Bismarck Monument Project of 1910. In many earlier instances he had used collage to construct more realistic views; this and other collages of the 1930s and ""40s, however, are less pictorial, more evocative. Thus the photograph of the rugged mountain landscape collaged into the window frames, with cowboys on horseback, does not represent the actual view from the site but suggests what could be considered a fantasy view on the architect's part.

R. Buckminster Fuller,"A Minimum Dymaxion Home project (Elevation, axonometric, and plan)","""How much does your house weigh?"" This typical provocation by Buckminster Fuller was aimed at critics of his Dymaxion House, a radically new environment for dwelling introduced in 1927 and so named for its ""maximum gain of advantage from minimal energy input."" This 1,600-square-foot house weighed only three tons; its cost was about the same as the price of a car. The dream of a low-cost factory-built house captured the attention of many socially conscious architects in the twentieth century: if the automobile industry could mass-produce their products quickly, efficiently, and relatively cheaply, why couldn""t a similar system be applied to housing? Perhaps no one pushed this idea as far as Fuller, an extraordinary genius, inventor, philosopher, architect, and engineer.
In the Dymaxion House, a central aluminum mast contains all the mechanical elements of the building in its core. Two hexagonal decks are suspended from this mast by triangulated tension cables. The house is enclosed within walls of double-panel vacuum glazing and is a fully air-conditioned environment. One of Fuller's students called the Dymaxion House a metallurgical pound cake, and indeed the rooms are divided into wedge shapes, seen most clearly in the color-coded plan.
The unconventional shape, structure, and materials of the Dymaxion House stood in sharp contrast to buildings by leading modernists such as Le Corbusier and Mies van der Rohe. Le Corbusier had described his own mass-produced housing as a ""machine for living in,"" and the Dymaxion House was unabashedly machinelike, but Fuller was highly critical of modern European architects, who he felt were preoccupied with cosmetic concerns that merely symbolized or aestheticized functional elements without a clear and honest display of function and efficiency.
The Dymaxion House never went into production, but after World War II, Fuller introduced a new version, the aluminum Wichita House, to be manufactured by the aircraft industry. Although several thousand advance orders were received, only one was built; the enterprise collapsed under bureaucratic delays. Fuller went on to design the famous Geodesic Dome, which applied some of the same principles of efficiency, shape, system, and materials that he had explored in the Dymaxion House. His work inspired many architects, but he was also accused of being overly technical at the expense of aesthetic merit, a charge to which he responded, ""I never work with aesthetic considerations in mind, but I have a test: if something isn""t beautiful when I get finished with it, it's no good.""

R. Buckminster Fuller's Dymaxion House was inspired by a desire to create widely available low cost housing. Fuller believed that by adopting the efficient and cost-effective assembly-line production methods used for the automobile he could produce a home at the same price as a car. The unusual hexagonal-shaped house was clad with double-panel vacuum-glazed walls and was fully air-conditioned. Its central aluminum core housed all mechanical equipment and provided the support structure for the roof and floor. Fuller's goal, ""maximum gain of advantage from minimal energy input,"" was never realized, but his concept introduced a radical new way of living to the general public. Despite numerous early orders, only one modified postwar version of the house was ever built.

They silkscreened [his image] of a greatly magnified yarrow leaf onto individual polycarbonate panels. Fitted together in stacked rows, the panels form the two long walls of the rectangular building, creating screens of repeating leaves that filter in sunlight and glow softly from its lights at night.

        Additional text






To enliven the interior of his Avery Coonley Playhouse, a kindergarten in the suburbs of Chicago for a private client, Frank Lloyd Wright designed stained-glass clerestory windows, which formed a continuous band around the top of the playroom. Each window in the series was composed of lively combinations of simple geometric motifs in bright colors. The windows were inspired by the sights of a parade, and their shapes abstracted from balloons, confetti, and even an American flag.
Wright designed the interior furnishings for almost all of his buildings, thereby creating an organic unity of the whole and its parts. Art glass was integral to the architectural fabric of many of his early works. The arranging of shapes into patterns in the Coonley Playhouse windows relates to the formal strategies Wright adopted in his architecture. His belief in the universality of fundamental geometric forms was as much a response to rational methods of modern machine production as an intuitive understanding that abstract forms carried shared spiritual values. Geometric forms had played a role in Wright's own childhood education through a German system of educational toys, the Froebel blocks, which he later credited as a major influence on his ideas about architecture.

Arthur Young,Bell-47D1 Helicopter,"More than three thousand Bell-47D1 helicopters were made in the United States and sold in forty countries between 1946 and 1973, when production ceased. While the Bell-47D1 is a straightforward utilitarian craft, its designer, Young, who was also a poet and a painter, consciously juxtaposed its transparent plastic bubble with the open structure of its tail boom to create an object whose delicate beauty is inseparable from its efficiency. That the plastic bubble is made in one piece rather than in sections joined by metal seams sets the Bell-47D1 apart from other helicopters. The result is a cleaner, more unified appearance.
The bubble also lends the hovering craft an insect-like appearance, which generated its nickname, the “bug-eyed helicopter.” It seems fitting, then, that one of the principal uses of the Bell-47D1 has been for pest control through crop-dusting and spraying. It has also been used for traffic surveillance and for the delivery of mail and cargo to remote areas. During the Korean War, it served as an aerial ambulance.
Awarded the world’s first commercial helicopter license by the US Civil Aeronautics Administration (now the Federal Aviation Administration), the Bell-47D1 weighs 1,380 pounds. Its maximum speed is ninety-two miles per hour, and its maximum range is 194 miles. It can hover like a dragonfly at altitudes up to ten thousand feet.

Charlotte Perriand,Revolving Armchair,"""Clutching a portfolio of drawings, I found myself face-to-face one October afternoon in 1927 with Le Corbusier's horn-rimmed spectacles. The austere office was somewhat intimidating, and his greeting rather frosty.

'To work with you.'
He glanced quickly through my drawings. 'We don't embroider cushions here,' he replied, and showed me the door.""
—Charlotte Perriand, Une Vie de creation (A life of creation), 1998
Following this incident, after viewing her designs for the 1927 Salon d'Automne, Le Corbusier hired Perriand, and she worked in his Paris studio for ten years. She immediately set to work on a series of furniture designs that were introduced to the public at the 1929 Salon d’Automne in Paris. In this design, partly inspired by an office swivel chair, Perriand softened the rigidity of the tubular frame with a stuffed cushion resting on coil springs. Because the frame and the upholstery required considerable handwork, the chair was relatively expensive and manufactured in limited numbers.

Hector Guimard,"Entrance Gate to Paris Subway (Métropolitain) Station, Paris, France","The emergence of the Art Nouveau style toward the end of the nineteenth century resulted from a search for a new aesthetic that was not based on historical or classical models. The sinuous, organic lines of Guimard’s design and the stylized, giant stalks drooping under the weight of what seem to be swollen tropical flowers, but are actually amber glass lamps, make this a quintessentially Art Nouveau piece. Guimard’s designs for this famous entrance arch and two others were intended to visually enhance the experience of underground travel on the new subway system for Paris.
Paris was not the first city to implement an underground train system (London already had one), but the approaching Paris Exposition of 1900 accelerated the need for an efficient and attractive means of mass transportation. Although Guimard never formally entered the competition for the design of the system’s entrance gates, launched in 1898 by the Compagnie du Métropolitain, he won the commission with his avant-garde schemes, which all employed standardized cast-iron components to facilitate manufacture, transport, and assembly.
While Parisians were at first hesitant in their response to Guimard’s use of a vocabulary associated with luxury jewelry and domestic furnishings, the Métro gates, installed throughout the city, effectively brought the Art Nouveau style into the realm of popular culture.

Marianne Brandt,Teapot,"Among the best-known products developed at the Bauhaus, the famed German school of modern art, architecture, and design, this teapot was a student work designed by Brandt soon after she joined the metal workshop there. The artist László Moholy-Nagy, who had taken over as the workshop’s form master in 1923, encouraged her to enter this male-dominated field at a time when virtually all female students in the school were relegated to textiles. An accomplished exercise in reducing an everyday object to a combination of elemental shapes, the teapot uses pure geometric forms inspired by the Constructivist aesthetic that Moholy-Nagy had introduced into the workshop. Its design is innovative yet functional, and it bears an ebony handle and finial that are comfortable to hold.
Although hand-forged from nickel silver, the teapot was among Brandt’s first attempts to develop pieces for industrial production. She later wrote that “the task was to shape these things in such a way that even if they were to be produced in numbers, making the work lighter, they would satisfy all aesthetic and practical criteria and still be far less expensive than any singly produced item.” The teapot remained a prototype, but some of her subsequent metalwork designs, especially for lighting, went into mass production. Brandt left the Bauhaus in 1929 when the metal workshop merged with other departments and ceased to be a vital area in the school.

Marcel Breuer,Club chair (model B3),"The model for this chair is the traditional overstuffed club chair, but all that remains is its mere outline, an elegant composition traced in gleaming steel. The canvas seat, back, and arms seem to float in space; the body of the sitter does not touch the steel framework. Breuer spoke of the chair as his “most extreme work . . . the least artistic, the most logical, the least ‘cozy’ and the most mechanical.” It was also his most influential piece of design, taking furniture in a radical new direction. Breuer had designed an earlier version in 1925, while teaching at the Bauhaus, the influential German school of modern art, architecture, and design in Dessau, and within a year designers everywhere were experimenting with tubular steel. Breuer claimed to have drawn inspiration from the tubular-steel handlebars of his bicycle, which were strong, lightweight, and mass-produced. He reasoned that if the material could be bent into handlebars, it could be bent into forms for furniture.
The chair was dubbed the “Wassily” after the painter Vasily (or Wassily) Kandinsky, Breuer’s friend and fellow Bauhaus instructor, who had praised the design when it was first produced. This example was given to MoMA by another Bauhaus colleague, Herbert Bayer, and was featured in the Museum’s landmark exhibition Machine Art in 1934.

Eileen Gray,Screen,"This black lacquered-wood screen, made of seven horizontal rows of panels joined by thin vertical metal rods, is not only a movable wall but also a sculpture composed of solids and voids with an underlying Cubist influence. It is among the most striking and elegant creations by Gray, who was one of the leading designers working in Paris after World War I. Gray popularized and perfected the art of lacquered furnishings, and her preference for this meticulous finish reveals a predilection for exotic materials, in particular those used in Japanese decorative arts.
Based on a larger version that Gray designed in 1922 for the Paris apartment of Madame Mathieu-Lévy, the owner of an exclusive millinery shop, the freestanding screen can be seen as a bridge between furniture, architecture, and sculpture. Gray also was an accomplished textile designer and architect. Her first major architectural project, the E-1027 House in Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, France, was composed of multifunctional rooms and furniture, and was much admired by the Swiss-French architect Le Corbusier. The flexibility inherent in that project was a continuation of Gray’s primary fascination in her earlier designs: pivoting parts and movable elements that transform both object and space.

        Additional text






“Art is not just the expression of abstract relationships,” Gray has written, “It must also encapsulate the most tangible relations, the most intimate needs of subjective life.” Consistent with these aims, this freestanding lacquered wood screen functions both as a movable wall to divide space and as an abstract modern sculpture composed of solids and voids. Working in Paris after World War I, Gray popularized and perfected the meticulous art of lacquered furnishings, which struck a chord with the contemporary taste for exotic materials, especially those used in Japanese decorative arts.

"Wilhelm Wagenfeld, Carl Jakob Jucker",Table lamp,"This object, known as the ""Bauhaus lamp,"" embodies an essential idea—form follows function—advanced by the influential Bauhaus school, founded in 1919 by the architect Walter Gropius, which taught a modern synthesis of both fine and applied arts. Through the employment of simple geometric shapes—circular base, cylindrical shaft, and spherical shade—Wagenfeld and Jucker achieved ""both maximum simplicity and, in terms of time and materials, greatest economy."" The lamp's working parts are visible; the opaque glass shade, a type formerly used only for industrial lighting, helps to diffuse the light.
The lamp was produced in the Bauhaus metal workshop after its re-organization under the direction of the artist László Moholy-Nagy in 1923. The workshop promoted the use of new materials and favored mass production under a collaborative, rather than individual, approach.
Initial attempts at marketing the lamp in 1924 were unsuccessful, primarily because most of its parts were still hand assembled at the Bauhaus. Today, the lamp is widely produced by Techno-lumen of Bremen, Germany, and is generally perceived as an icon of modern industrial design.

Robert Rauschenberg,Shades,"Shades was Rauschenberg’s first illustrated book, but instead of paper, it is constructed from an aluminum frame holding a fixed title page and five movable plates of plexiglass. The artist lithographed numerous images taken from newspapers and magazines on each panel. When the square plates are inserted into the base—in one of six million possible permutations—the work becomes three-dimensional and its many transparent layers are visible in the glow from a small light bulb attached in the back.

Liliana Porter,Wrinkle,"This series of photo-etchings shows the gradual crumpling of a blank piece of paper—a harmless act of destruction enacted on a banal object. Rather than drawing the images by hand, Porter chose to capture them photographically, thus limiting her manual intervention. A cofounder of the New York Graphic Workshop (active 1965–70), Porter was interested in emphasizing printmaking’s conceptual possibilities over its technical attributes. Her use of sequence and humor, as well as her objective approach to materials, connect her work to the emergence of Minimal and Conceptual art in New York City, where she has lived since 1964.

Ben Shahn,Handball,"Best known today as a painter, Shahn was also a prolific photographer—for a period in the 1930s, in fact, he was paid to take photographs by the U.S. government's Farm Security Administration, which hired him to document the hardships of rural American life. Shahn's photographs were the starting points for some of his paintings, including Handball. In a 1957 interview, Shahn described his painting as being about ""social relationships,"" including those as seemingly simple as the relationships among ball players. In this painting the figures face away from us, engrossed in the world contained by the massive concrete wall of the handball court. The nuances of their relationship are suggested but ultimately hidden.

Odilon Redon,Roger and Angelica,"In this evocation of a scene from the sixteenth-century romance Orlando Furioso, the knight Roger appears on his fiery steed to save the maiden Angelica from a horrible fate: the dragon, with its evil inner glow, is looming at the lower left. Tendrils of threatening mist curling up from below menace the maiden, while angry storm clouds hover above. The figures themselves are small and sketchily rendered; it is the picture's atmospheric effects, conveyed with light-and-dark contrasts and shots of dazzling color—including those of the imposing crag on which Angelica is stranded—that create the high drama of this tension-ridden scene.
The young Redon is said to have watched the clouds scudding over the flat Bordeaux landscape where he was raised and imagined in them the fantastic beings that he would later conjure up in his paintings, drawings, lithographs, and pastels. Roger and Angelica, executed in the last period of his career, when color had bewitched him, exemplifies Redon's consummate ability to imbue his wildly imaginative fantasies with color, light, and shadow, using the mere strokes of a crayon.
Although this work was created in the twentieth century, it reflects the Romanticism of the nineteenth century, in which feeling triumphed over form, and color was the primary vehicle of expression.

Paul Klee,Fire in the Evening,"A red opaque rectangle stands out among bands of muted browns, greens, violets, and blues, which dynamically interact to suggest built structures or geographic formations. Klee's trip to Egypt in the winter of 1928-29 inspired a number of striated compositions, a response in part to the stratified cliffs of the Nile Valley and the long strips of tilled fields he saw there. These works ""moved far from Nature,"" he said, ""and found their way back to reality."" While the work is apparently abstract, the variation within the simple formal palette of line and color constructs depth and space and even evokes a fire aflame in a desert at day's end.

These printing tools were borrowed from a commercial press. Ernst arranged the plates, frequently turning and reusing the same block and adding connecting lines with pen and ink to produce images of anthropomorphic machines. Rather than evoking dependable technological power, the pseudo-machine depicted in this work seems precarious at best.

From 1919 to 1920, Ernst created a series of works by arranging small metal plates or type that he borrowed from a commercial press into images of anthropomorphic machines; after printing them he added connecting lines or shading in pen and ink. Rather than evoking dependable technological power, the pseudomachine depicted here seems precarious at best. The title refers to Marie Laurencin, a French artist who assisted Ernst in his failed attempt to exhibit his artwork in Paris. “Help!” scribbled in both French and German adds a note of urgency.

Glenn Ligon,Untitled (There is a consciousness we all have...),"Since the mid–1980s Ligon has explored issues of identity, race, and sexuality across a wide range of media, from paintings and three–dimensional objects to prints, photographs, and drawings. In this early work, Ligon incorporates his characteristic use of language, investigating and manipulating the immense power of words. Later, in the 1990s, Ligon appropriated literary texts by black authors such as Ralph Ellison and James Baldwin. In this work he refers to a comment made in the New York Times about Martin Puryear, another contemporary African American artist: ""There is a consciousness we all have that he is a black American artist but I think his work is really superior and stands on its own.""
By stenciling this sentence in capital letters across two adjacent sheets of paper, Ligon purposefully and effectively creates disruptive breaks in the text, further disconnecting the sentence from any concrete reference to Puryear's work and forcefully pointing out the misguided practice of using race as a factor in judging the quality of a work of art. Furthermore, painted in light ochre, the words are not easily legible against the background, and only through a concerted effort can the text be read. Through such moments of discontinuity and ambiguity, Ligon has created an ironic and provocative visual statement about the critical reception of black artists and perceptions of race in general.

Fernand Léger,Mise-en-scène for the ballet La Création du monde (The Creation of the World),"For the 1923 Ballets Suédois production (premiere Paris). Choreography by Jean Börlin. Music by Darius Milhaud. Scenario by Blaise Cendrars, based on an African legend
This work exemplifies the way Léger and other artists associated with Cubism made use of African sculpture for their own pictorial, compositional, and narrative ends. Along with the ballet's jazz–inflected score and frenzied choreography, these designs shed light on the fascination with the ""primitive"" so in vogue in Paris at that time.
These drawings depict Nzame, Medere, and N'kava, the ballet's deities of creation, who emerge from chaos and oversee the transformation of flora and fauna from an undistinguished mass into an organized dance. According to the ballet's composer, Léger rejected several early designs he deemed ""too bright and 'pretty-pretty,'"" and he was ""never satisfied that his sketches were terrifying enough.""

Paul Klee,Twittering Machine (Die Zwitscher-Maschine),"A violent marriage of nature and industry, the crazy contraption in Twittering Machine mechanizes the songs of birds. All but one bird are tethered to a perch that can be turned by a handle over a pit, a potential trap for the latest choir member. Constructed with Klee’s characteristic wiry, agile black line, the birds lurch and cry out, their tongues resembling both musical notes and fishhooks. Klee described drawing as “an active line on a walk, moving freely” and connected his liberated line to his belief that “through the universe, movement is the rule.” In this drawing, humans turn movement and song against nature, making them activities of enslavement.
Klee treated line and color independently of each other, creating tension between the paper’s surface and the work’s atmospheric depth. He employed an oil-transfer process to copy the image from another sheet onto this one, using a needle to trace the original, which he had placed over a page covered with dried oil paint that was, in turn, placed facedown against this sheet. Distancing the artist’s hand from the final drawing, this process resulted in seemingly accidental smudges that emphasize the flatness of the picture plane. By contrast, the painted blue backdrop opens into boundless space. As an acid-pink stain of watercolor encircles the scene, the world appears to close in on the birds, reverberating with the cacophonous chaos of their songs.

Berenice Abbott,"Canyon: Broadway and Exchange Place, Manhattan","Having spent several years in France closely studying Eugène Atget’s documentation of a disappearing Paris, Abbott returned to New York in 1929 to find a city transformed. Fueled by a financial bubble that was soon to pop, newly constructed skyscrapers created dizzying views and canyon-like streets that dwarfed the scale of human activity. Abbott’s attentive urban observations were captured in her 1939 photobook Changing New York. Related photographs had been published years earlier in the French weekly Vu, testifying to the transatlantic transmission of such imagery.

Lisette Model,Window Reflections,"Model immigrated to the United States from Vienna in 1938. In New York, she was active in the Photo League, an organization that served as both a community of photographers and a forum dedicated to advancing social change through creative photography in a progressive documentary tradition. In Window Reflections, Model brought together multiple strands prevalent in European and American photography, from experimental graphic and spatial play to the scrutiny of urban life. The facial features of her subject have vanished into his shadowed form, while the cacophonous signs of the city are reflected against his silhouette, provoking the viewer to contemplate what he might be thinking.

Hilaire-Germain-Edgar Degas,Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Stéphane Mallarmé,"Although better known for his Impressionist paintings and prints, Degas spent five years making photographs of family members and artist friends. “These days, Degas abandons himself entirely to his new passion for photography,"" wrote a peer in 1895. After dinner parties ended, he enlisted fellow guests as models. In this photograph, the poet Stéphane Mallarmé looks down at the painter Pierre-Auguste Renoir. In the mirror behind them, Degas can be glimpsed operating the camera, using a bright magnesium flash. Photographing indoors was difficult during this time, given the technological limitations; even with the flash and nine carefully arranged kerosene lamps, his sitters still needed to hold their poses for several minutes.

Gordon Parks,Harlem Gang Wars,"Gordon Parks was the first African American staff photographer for Life magazine. In the late 1940s, he proposed a story on the gang wars that were then consuming Harlem. Published in the November 1, 1948 issue under the title “Harlem Gang Leader,” it was one of his earliest photo essays for the magazine. Parks used his camera to share his insider’s view of life in the neighborhood amidst these clashes. At the heart of his story was Red Jackson, the young leader of the Midtowners gang. Parks shot hundreds of photographs that capture details of Jackson’s life, gang relations, and contemporary Harlem. Some of the pictures revel in the ambiguity that the camera afforded—this image of boys in the street could be read as playful if seen in a different context.
Of the hundreds of images Parks took, Life’s editors chose 21, which they cropped, printed, and sequenced into a narrative emphasizing the drama and sensation of the conflicts. Many magazine photographers, including Parks, resented the way the meaning and interpretation of their work was skewed.

Jacob August Riis,"Lodgers in Bayard Street Tenement, Five Cents a Spot","In the late nineteenth century, many immigrants in New York City lived in crowded tenement apartments that lacked the modern conveniences of the bourgeois home, such as artificial lighting. For this reason, when social reformer and police reporter Jacob Riis set out to photograph these working-class inhabitants, he brought his own flash apparatus: a frying pan filled with flammable magnesium. Although his intention—to stir the conscience of the upper classes with his documents of urban poverty—was progressive, his methods were intrusive. Riis often entered homes without permission, opening his camera shutter and blinding unsuspecting sitters with an explosion of light. His illustrated book How the Other Half Lives (1890), which includes this photograph and many others, led to laws making tenements safer and more habitable.

James Van Der Zee,Baptism Celebration,"Van Der Zee, a portrait photographer, worked in New York during the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s and 1930s. His subjects range from families and newly married couples to public figures such as Marcus Garvey. In Baptism Celebration to Maria Warma Mercado, Van Der Zee recorded the assembled party in their finest attire, complete with celebratory hats. This picture was taken in a private home, but the artist made many of his portraits in his studio, using a range of props and backdrops. Largely self-taught, Van Der Zee developed a retouching technique, often painting directly onto the negative or print to achieve his desired level of idealization.

Iwata Nakayama,Fukusuke Tabi,"With its sensuous contours and refined, stripped-down graphic qualities, this picture vividly translates a traditional garment—Japanese tabi socks—into the language of modernity. Nakayama received the first prize for this picture at the First International Advertising Photography Competition in Tokyo, sponsored by one of the largest national newspapers in Japan. A leading proponent of the Shinko Shashin (New Photography) movement, Nakayama studied photography in California, operated a portrait studio in New York, and produced magazine work in Paris before returning to Japan in 1927.

László Moholy-Nagy,Head,"The term abstraction, as it is generally applied to photography, is misleading. Completely indecipherable photographs are quite rare and usually quite boring. More common and more interesting are pictures such as this one, in which an unfamiliar configuration of form competes for our attention with what we are inclined to call the subject—in this case, the woman's face. That competition is the true subject of the picture.
Moholy-Nagy taught at the Bauhaus in Germany between 1920 and 1933. He began his career as a painter, but in the mid-1920s he came to regard photography as the universal visual language of the modern era because it was mechanical and impersonal and, therefore, objective—no matter how unexpected the results might be. Perhaps it was precisely the unpredictability of photography that he loved, because it unveiled fresh experiences.
In 1925 he published a picture book titled Painting, Photography, Film, which illustrated the many ways in which photography challenged old habits of seeing—by showing very distant or very small things, for example, or by looking up or down. The great majority of the illustrations were the work of scientists, journalists, amateurs, and illustrators—not of artists. The message was clear: photography had revolutionized modern vision without the aid of ""art.""
Head. c. 1926

Staged to resemble scenes from 1950s and ’60s Hollywood, film noir, B movies, and European art-house films, the printed images mimic in format, scale, and quality the often-staged “stills” used to promote films. By photographing herself in such roles, Sherman inserts herself into a dialogue about stereotypical portrayals of women. Whether she was the one to release the camera’s shutter or not, she is considered the author of the photographs. However, the works in Untitled Film Stills are not considered self-portraits.

        Additional text






In her Untitled Film Stills, Sherman posed as various female characters from 1950s and 1960s Hollywood, film noir, and European art-house films we feel we must have seen. The series reads like an encyclopedic roster of stereotypical roles: the pert young career girl in the big city, the chic starlet at her seaside hideaway, the tough but vulnerable film-noir idol. “The still must tease with the promise of a story the viewer of it itches to be told,” Sherman said. Entirely fictitious, these “stills” deftly encapsulate the images of femininity that, through the media culture of movies, had a hold on America’s collective imagination at the time.

Walker Evans,Minstrel Showbill,"Over the course of his career, Evans created an unvarnished portrait of the United States, photographing people, buildings, and signage, including this poster advertising a minstrel show peeling off a brick wall. Minstrel shows were an exploitative form of popular entertainment throughout the US from the 19th century into the 1950s that reinforced white supremacy by perpetuating painful and negative stereotypes of African Americans. Taken in 1936 during the Great Depression, while Evans was on assignment for the Farm Security Administration, this photograph serves as a record of the long history of violence and oppression facing the country’s Black communities.

Otto Dix,Syphilitic (Syphilitiker),"In paintings, drawings, and prints, Otto Dix portrayed the corruption and social apathy of German society after World War I with harsh, critical realism. Completing some three hundred prints during his lifetime, he experimented extensively with etching, lithography, and woodcut, making his most significant printed work during the early 1920s in response to the horror of the war and its aftermath.
In 1909 Dix moved to Dresden to study art. At the onset of World War I he volunteered to serve as a machine gunner and suffered serious wounds in front-line advances through Belgium and France. When he returned to Dresden to resume his studies, Dix joined a group of young radical Expressionists and also had contact with Dadaists, whose anarchism encouraged his growing nihilism. Directing a critical eye toward German society, Dix became preoccupied with subjects like veterans and urban decay, as well as prostitution and the destructive power of sex. In Syphilitic, evil temptation literally fills a man's head, as he suffers from the madness brought on by this disease.
In the early 1920s, Dix was encouraged by art dealer Karl Nierendorf to make prints for broad distribution. He turned to illustrating the devastation of the trench warfare he had experienced, creating an epic series of fifty intaglios that have been compared to Goya's The Disasters of War. The imagery in this series differs radically from the 1916–18 Futurist-influenced sketches he had made at the front, when, deeply interested in the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche, he enthusiastically embraced war as an inevitable part of life. In these later images, Dix portrays the destructive effects of war, including rotting corpses and bombed cities and landscapes, as well as its dehumanizing impact. In Storm Troops Advance under Gas Attack, soldiers are shown as menacing ghouls whose depravity is emphasized by terrifying gas masks.

Hilaire-Germain-Edgar Degas,Green Landscape (Paysage vert),"Impressionist painter and draftsman Hilaire-Germain-Edgar Degas was one of the preeminent peintres-graveurs (painter-printmakers) of his time. The term refers to nineteenth-century painters who created their own printed compositions as opposed to those who made reproductive prints based on the work of others. Degas had a rather unusual approach to making prints, which he did for his own private experience and experimentation rather than for a public audience. Thus, although he completed approximately sixty-six printed compositions, only four of these were published in editions during his lifetime. The bulk of his graphic output consists of trial proofs, working proofs, states, variants, unique monotypes, and hand-colored impressions that document the tireless reworking, scraping, and erasing that were part of his artistic process.
Degas's involvement with prints is visible throughout his career. He copied Old Master etchings by Rembrandt and Velázquez as an early form of study; later he made lithographs of modern urban scenes, using the café-concert, theater, ballet, and streets of Paris as his subjects. He kept an etching press in his studio and constantly experimented by combining mediums and using unorthodox tools. He even planned a never-realized journal, Le Jour et la nuit, with artist friends Mary Cassatt, Camille Pissarro, and Félix Bracquemond that would have issued original prints to subscribers. In addition, Degas was perhaps the most prolific and innovative practitioner of monotype during the nineteenth century, completing hundreds of compositions during his lifetime. These two monotypes, among fifty landscape motifs made between 1890 and 1893, were inspired by a twenty-day carriage trip through Burgundy. Loosely executed and almost abstract, they depict the idea of a landscape rather than any particular view or location, a concept that the artist referred to as ""imaginary landscapes.""

Paul Gauguin,Noa Noa (Fragrant Scent) from Noa Noa (Fragrant Scent),"Ever seized by wanderlust, Paul Gauguin sought to abandon the European life he viewed as conventional and artificial in favor of one in tune with nature and free of the constraints of Western social mores. In search of a more vital and authentic way of life, he made his first sojourn to Tahiti in 1891. Although the island was not the untouched Eden he had hoped for, he was still greatly inspired by the people, culture, and lifestyle there, and these new influences were reflected in his paintings, sculptures, and drawings. After he returned to Europe in 1893, he began working on Noa Noa (Tahitian for ""fragrance""), a book project based on his Tahitian experience and illustrated with woodcuts that were meant to make his new art more understandable to his contemporaries. Although never realized in their intended form, both the text and the ten woodcuts for Noa Noa survive among Gauguin's seventy-eight printed compositions in woodcut, etching, and lithography.
The Noa Noa woodcuts illustrate everything that drew Gauguin to printmaking. Although the woodcut had seen a modest revival in the nineteenth century, no example matched the audacity of Gauguin's approach to the medium, which allowed him to work on a natural, ""primitive"" matrix, creating works that combined the sculptural gouging of his carved wood low reliefs with the evocative color of his paintings. It also provided seemingly endless opportunity for experimentation. Gauguin printed Noa Noa blocks with various inkings and color combinations, on different papers, and sometimes slightly off-register to create a blurred, dreamlike image, as in The Gods. In addition to the Noa Noa woodcuts printed by the artist, impressions were also pulled by the professional printer Louis Roy during the artist's lifetime; others were produced posthumously by Gauguin's son, Pola, and by others.

Erich Heckel,Kneeling Nudes (Kniende Akte) from Brücke 1910,"Between 1906 and 1912 the Brücke group sent an annual portfolio of prints to its ""passive members""—friends and supporters who helped finance the artists' work. Through these portfolios, artists could circumvent intermediaries of the art market, such as dealers and galleries, and communicate directly with patrons. Each installment was dedicated to the work of one artist. The fifth portfolio features prints by Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, alternating between urban scenes of licentious delight and views of the idyllic Moritzburg lakes, which the Brücke artists frequently visited.
Erich Heckel's title page shows two nudes kneeling on a stage. A schematic section of geometric voids and solids represents a row of spectators, while the garish yellow paper suggests the glare of the lights. Kirchner's color woodcut, Mit Schilf werfende Badende (Bathers throwing reeds), shows nudes moving freely in nature. His black-and-white woodcut, Tänzerin mit gehobenem Rock (Dancer with raised skirt), transports this key theme of the liberated body to a Dresden cabaret. Kirchner exploits the stark contrasts and reductive possibilities encouraged by the woodcut medium, heralding the severely angular style of the group's last years. In the final drypoint, Drei Badende an den Moritzburger Seen (Three bathers at the Moritzburg lakes), Kirchner creates a scene of peace and harmony using the most limited formal means, capturing the spontaneity and freedom the artists discovered at rural retreats.

Ernst Ludwig Kirchner,Dancer with Raised Skirt (Tänzerin mit gehobenem Rock) from Brücke 1910,"It was within the artists' group Brücke (Bridge), founded in 1905, that Ernst Ludwig Kirchner formulated his views on art and established a visual language. Together with other core members—Erich Heckel, Karl Schmidt-Rottluff, Max Pechstein, and, briefly, Emil Nolde—Kirchner sought a new spirit of freedom and authenticity that rejected both the stultifying traditions of the academy and the restrictive conventions of bourgeois society. Brücke artists felt that art could respond to essential life forces with spontaneity and immediacy through such subjects as the nude in nature or figures dancing with frenzy and abandon. Sharing studios and models, teaching each other techniques, and even vacationing together, they evolved a common style that first embraced the fluidity of Fauvism and then turned to the energy and angularity of tribal art for inspiration.
Printmaking was fundamental to Brücke activities, and annual portfolios of prints were published to help the artists gain recognition and produce income. For the most part, however, members' prints were experimental in nature and made with only a few proof impressions. Kirchner continued this unstructured approach to printmaking even after the dissolution of Brücke in 1913, eventually creating some two thousand works, primarily in his own studio.
During World War I, after briefly training in the mounted artillery, Kirchner suffered a mental collapse. His depiction as an isolated figure is seen here in Evening Patrol of 1915. His series of prints of this period, entitled Schlemihl Meets His Shadow, is also considered the embodiment of his anxiety and paranoia, conditions that would continue to plague him, along with ill health, for the remainder of his life. In 1938, after being ostracized from German art circles by the Nazis, and having hundreds of his paintings removed from museums and declared ""degenerate,"" Kirchner ended his own life.

        Additional text






Between 1906 and 1912 the Brücke group sent an annual portfolio of prints to its ""passive members""—friends and supporters who helped finance the artists' work. Through these portfolios, artists could circumvent intermediaries of the art market, such as dealers and galleries, and communicate directly with patrons. Each installment was dedicated to the work of one artist. The fifth portfolio features prints by Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, alternating between urban scenes of licentious delight and views of the idyllic Moritzburg lakes, which the Brücke artists frequently visited.
Erich Heckel's title page shows two nudes kneeling on a stage. A schematic section of geometric voids and solids represents a row of spectators, while the garish yellow paper suggests the glare of the lights. Kirchner's color woodcut, Mit Schilf werfende Badende (Bathers throwing reeds), shows nudes moving freely in nature. His black-and-white woodcut, Tänzerin mit gehobenem Rock (Dancer with raised skirt), transports this key theme of the liberated body to a Dresden cabaret. Kirchner exploits the stark contrasts and reductive possibilities encouraged by the woodcut medium, heralding the severely angular style of the group's last years. In the final drypoint, Drei Badende an den Moritzburger Seen (Three bathers at the Moritzburg lakes), Kirchner creates a scene of peace and harmony using the most limited formal means, capturing the spontaneity and freedom the artists discovered at rural retreats.

Max Beckmann,Self-Portrait in Bowler Hat (Selbstbildnis mit steifem Hut),"Max Beckmann was among the foremost painters of the modern period, known for his enigmatic allegorical compositions illustrating the trials and tribulations of the human condition. Although he began his career working in a theatrical Post-Impressionist style, Beckmann's harrowing experience as a medical orderly in World War I transformed his art into one of compressed angular arrangements, peopled with the disaffected and disenfranchised of Germany's postwar society. In biblical scenes, crowded café pictures, circus tableaux, and self-portraits, he reflected the unrelenting anxiety and alienation he perceived in modern life.
Beckmann completed more than three hundred seventy prints, the vast majority between the years 1915 and 1924. He began his prolific career with lithography. Just before the war, however, he discovered that drypoint, which enabled him to create staccato marks and scratchy textures, matched his nervous, agitated state. Working without the aid of preliminary drawings, he attacked the plates directly, often pulling proofs on his personal press before sending the plates to be editioned. Although he essentially divided his printmaking between lithography and drypoint, Beckmann also tried his hand at woodcut. He completed only nineteen but their bold contrasts, abrupt croppings, and disengaged gazes make them among his most powerful graphic statements on the theme of isolation in the modern urban environment.
Beckmann's early successes as a painter attracted some of Germany's leading publishers, including Reinhard Piper in Munich and J. B. Neumann in Berlin, who commissioned the artist's major print portfolios. The series format provided Beckmann with the perfect vehicle to explore his allegorical narratives. In Night from the portfolio Hell he portrays the violence and decadence surrounding the Berlin riots of November 1918 and the founding of the Weimar Republic. With Mannerist distortion and foreshortened perspective he depicts the horrific scene in a stagelike setting, implicating the viewer as the audience of this ugly spectacle.

Claes Oldenburg,Profile Airflow,"When Oldenburg was a child, he played with a toy version of the 1937 Chrysler Airflow, the first car designed according to aerodynamic principles. Profile Airflow was inspired in part by that memory. The artist, known for his soft sculptures based on everyday objects, wanted it to be “clear in color, transparent like a swimming pool, but of a consistency like flesh.” He credits Kenneth Tyler, master printer and cofounder of the printmaking workshop Gemini G.E.L., for collaborating with industrial chemists over more than two years to develop a polyurethane material that was at once solid, flexible, and transparent.

Thomas Bayrle,VW Red,"In the 1960s, Bayrle developed a signature visual language of intricately patterned images. Drawing on his experience working in a weaving factory, he constructed tightly bound compositions, using images drawn from mass-media sources to create repeating rhythms. Exploring an optical play between figure and ground, Bayrle rendered his chosen icons—from a Volkswagen to film director Orson Welles—by tiling tiny pictures to generate both an overall pattern and a single image standing out against the background. This visual overload was a response to Germany’s exploding consumer culture in the 1960s and to the ease of reproducing images in the medium of screenprint. Bayrle was an important figure in German Pop art, and his work has been of great interest to the Museum. Due to the scarcity of available works, until recently the collection contained only one print by Bayrle (VW Red, 1969); in 2010, the artist made a group of impressions available to MoMA from his personal archive.

Claes Oldenburg,Store Poster,"Best known for his oversized soft sculptures of food and consumer objects of the Pop art period, Claes Oldenburg began his career staging avant-garde performances, constructing environments, publishing writings, and generally embracing the commerce of everyday life. Printed work has always played a central role in his art, beginning with commercially produced announcements and ephemera for his Happenings, and continuing with traditional printmaking. Unlike most Pop artists, Oldenburg has been drawn to lithography because of its affinity to drawing rather than to the commercial look of screenprint. He has also produced a significant body of etchings. Engaging various concepts of reproduction and mass-circulation over the course of his career, Oldenburg has created more than two hundred fifty works, designated as ""printed stuff"" by the compilers of his catalogue raisonné.
Oldenburg's environment called _The Store—_a storefront display on New York's Lower East Side, shown from December 1961 to January 1962—epitomized the artist's mingling of art, commodity, and commerce. At The Store, he sold painted plaster-and-wire constructions of familiar foodstuffs, clothing, and merchandise, elevating the status of these objects to art. To advertise his endeavor, Oldenburg created numerous printed works, such as business cards, stationery, and posters, including this hand-colored lithograph. Characterized by both a spontaneity of artistic gesture and the desire to self-promote, this print combines the tendencies of 1950s Abstract Expressionists with art's new embrace of consumer culture. The title of the enterprise, The Store, appears at the top, its address of 107 East 2nd Street at the bottom, and the artist's signature in reverse below the title. Oldenburg's array of objects, including a shirt and tie and a piece of cake, capture the humor and irony of this seminal event in contemporary American art.

Käthe Kollwitz,The Sacrifice (Das Opfer) from War (Krieg),"In 1919, Käthe Kollwitz began work on Krieg (War), her response to the tragedies endured during what she called those ""unspeakably difficult years"" of World War I and its aftermath. The portfolio's seven woodcuts focus on the sorrows of those left behind—mothers, widows, and children. Kollwitz had struggled to find the appropriate means of expression until she saw an exhibition of Ernst Barlach's woodcuts in 1920.

Only one print, Die Freiwilligen (The volunteers), shows the combatants. In it, Kollwitz's younger son, Peter, takes his place next to Death, who leads the troops in an ecstatic procession to war. Peter was killed in action just two months later. Kollwitz wanted these works to be widely viewed. By eliminating references to a specific time or place, she created universally legible indictments of the real sacrifices demanded in exchange for abstract concepts of honor and glory. The prints were exhibited in 1924 at the newly founded International Anti-War Museum in Berlin.

Käthe Kollwitz,The Parents (Die Eltern) from War (Krieg),"Käthe Kollwitz devoted herself to depicting the social and political injustices she witnessed in Germany during the tumultuous periods surrounding World Wars I and II. Trained at the School for Women Artists in Berlin during the 1880s, she turned to printmaking early in her career, feeling that it was the medium most befitting social criticism. During her lifetime, she made two hundred sixty prints, including etchings, lithographs, and woodcuts, some of which were used as poster compositions for various social causes.
The Parents is one from a series of woodcuts about World War I, a popular subject for many artists' print portfolios. Her series continued a tradition of apocalyptic print cycles that, in Europe, reaches back to the sixteenth century. Rather than depicting its violence, however, Kollwitz chose to focus on the emotional damage inflicted on the home front, especially on the women who lose sons, husbands, and brothers. Kollwitz herself never recovered from the death of her son Peter who, only months after joining the German army, was killed in combat in 1914.
Five years after his death, finding herself dissatisfied with lithography, Kollwitz experimented with the woodcut medium, hoping to find a print technique with which she could convey her grief, as well as strengthen and simplify her images. Searching for universal icons for the devastation imposed by war, she exploited the woodcut's inherent qualities to express the raw agony of war on the human psyche, slashing and gouging the wood to heighten the emotional impact of her images, and often silhouetting her black figures against the stark white smoothness of unprinted paper.

Otto Dix,War Cripples (Kriegskrüppel),"War veterans in full military dress march along a city street. Such horrifically maimed and disfigured men were far from uncommon in Germany after World War I, when 80,000 amputees returned home from the front. Reliant on prosthetics, canes, and crutches, these veterans have become as mechanized as the war that claimed their flesh. Yet even while depicting the tragic results of the conflict, Dix imbues the work with caustic humor: the veterans are passing a shoemaker (identified by the boot in the shop window and the word Schuhmacherei), a service for which, thanks to the war, they now have limited need.
Kriegskrüppel (War cripples) is one of Dix's earliest attempts at using drypoint, which he learned from the artist Conrad Felixmüller in Dresden. He based this print on a painting, which the Nazis later condemned as degenerate and destroyed.

Félix Vallotton,Poker (Le Poker),"Containing bold contrasts of light and shadow, Vallotton’s woodcuts suggest the increasing adoption of artificial light by Parisian households in the 1890s. Whereas the room shown in Le Poker is shadowy and dimly lit by flickering candles, other interiors appear to be bathed in the illumination of gas lamplight or newly available electrical fixtures. In prints from the series Intimités (Intimacies), the artist depicted members of the bourgeois class in private domestic scenes. The uncanny drama of Vallotton’s artificial lighting hints at the interior lives and psychologies of these married couples, including their boredom, foibles, and casual betrayals.

Paul Cézanne,The Bather,"In the 1870s, Cezanne began depicting scenes of bathers—groups of men and women lounging, swimming, and standing in and around wooded watering holes. In this work, he focused on the figure of a single young man standing with hands on hips, one foot in front of the other, and eyes downcast. Cezanne admired classical traditions of landscape and portraiture, yet compared with the muscular bodies and idealized proportions of academic painting, this bather appears awkward—both physically ungraceful and psychologically remote. The painting’s unified palette and brushstrokes likewise defy the conventional hierarchy of figure over background: here they are almost interdependent, set apart by the distinct black outline of the bather’s body but also echoing and sometimes dissolving into one another.
The artist began his career as an Impressionist painter, and his work reflects the influence of that movement’s experiments with the optical effects of color. Cezanne, however, was not interested in color’s atmospheric properties, as the Impressionists were, but instead explored its qualities of solidity and space, trying, as he said, “to render perspective solely by means of color.” Whereas the Impressionists painted from life, Cezanne based this bather on a photograph of a man posed in a studio, transferring him in paint to an outdoor scene.

Robert Delaunay,Simultaneous Contrasts: Sun and Moon,"Delaunay was fascinated by how the interaction of colors produces sensations of depth and movement, without reference to the natural world. In Simultaneous Contrasts that movement is the rhythm of the cosmos, for the painting's circular frame is a sign for the universe, and its flux of reds and oranges, greens and blues, is attuned to the sun and the moon, the rotation of day and night. But the star and planet, refracted by light, go undescribed in any literal way. ""The breaking up of form by light creates colored planes,"" Delaunay said. ""These colored planes are the structure of the picture, and nature is no longer a subject for description but a pretext."" Indeed, he had decided to abandon ""images or reality that come to corrupt the order of color.""
The poet Guillaume Apollinaire christened Delaunay's style ""Orphism,"" after Orpheus, the musician of Greek legend whose eloquence on the lyre is a mythic archetype for the power of art. The musicality of Delaunay's work lay in color, which he studied closely. In fact, he derived the phrase ""Simultaneous Contrasts"" from the treatise On the Law of the Simultaneous Contrast of Colors, published in 1839 by Michel-Eugène Chevreul. Absorbing Chevreul's scientific analyses, Delaunay has here gone beyond them into a mystical belief in color, its fusion into unity symbolizing the possibility for harmony in the chaos of the modern world.

Pablo Picasso,Girl before a Mirror,"This image of a young woman and her mirror reflection is riotous in color and chockablock with pattern. It is one of the last in a major series of canvases that Picasso created between 1931 and 1932. According to The Museum of Modern Art’s founding director, Alfred H. Barr, Jr., Picasso said he “preferred this painting to any of the others,” which speaks to the painting’s dazzling visual and thematic complexity. Its primary subject is the time-honored artistic theme of a woman before her mirror, reinvented in strikingly modern terms. The girl’s smoothly painted profile, in a delicately blushing pink-lavender, abuts a heavily built-up and garishly colored frontal view in yellow and red. Allusions to youth and old age, sun and moon, light and shadow are compressed into a single multivalent face.
The female protagonist of Girl before a Mirror actively reaches out to embrace the mirror that frames her reflection—a nominally fleeting image that paradoxically displays a pronounced physicality. The picture’s rigorous symmetrical organization creates a structure against which the curves of the model’s head and body, as well as those of her reflection, register all the more strongly. Her ithyphallic left arm and testicular breasts continue the game of visual punning seen in Picasso’s other paintings and sculptures of the time, in which facial and bodily features double as male and female sex organs.

Otto Dix,Dr. Mayer-Hermann,"Dr. Mayer-Hermann was a renowned throat specialist whose waiting room was filled with the most prominent singers and actresses of his day. Dix was among his patients. While Dix is best known for his unflinching depictions of prostitutes, disabled war veterans, and other traumatized subjects, here he depicts an established professional with wit and satire. The abundance of circular shapes that fill the canvas parodies the doctor's round body and face—from the curves of his chubby hands and the round bags under his eyes to the reflector on his headband and the mirror above his head.

When Dix painted this picture of Wilhelm Mayer-Hermann, a prominent Berlin doctor, he was a favorite portraitist of Germany's cultural bohemia and its patrons. Yet his eye could be coolly unflattering. Dix had fought in World War I, a crucial formative experience: ""It is necessary to see people in this unchained condition in order to know something about man,"" he said, and he came out of the war wanting ""to depict things as they really are."" Having experimented earlier with Expressionist and other modern styles, in 1920 he abandoned them for an approach and technique modeled on fifteenth- and sixteenth-century German art. In the process he was identified with what became known as the Neue Sachlichkeit (New Objectivity) movement, which advocated an unsentimental realism in the treatment of modern life.
Dix may portray the doctor exactingly, but the pose and the setting seem chosen to stress his rotundity. Everything is round: the face, the bags under the eyes, the double chin, the shoulders, the position of the arms, the tummy. A round lamp is affixed to the doctor's forehead, and behind him are a round clock-face and a round electrical socket. However precise the depiction, it verges on satire.

Frida Kahlo,Self-Portrait with Cropped Hair,"In this self-portrait, Kahlo has cast off the feminine attributes with which she often depicted herself—such as traditional embroidered Tehuana dresses or flowers in her hair—and instead sports a loose-fitting man’s suit and short-clipped haircut. Her high-heeled shoes and one dangling earring remain, however, along with her characteristic penetrating outward gaze. Locks of hair are strewn across the floor, a severed braid lies next to her chair, and the artist holds a pair of scissors across her lap. This androgynous persona may refer to Kahlo’s own bisexuality, while the lyrics of a popular Mexican song that appear at top suggest the address of a lover: “Look, if I loved you it was because of your hair. Now that you are without hair, I don’t love you anymore.” Kahlo and her husband, the artist Diego Rivera, had divorced in late 1939, and the painting indicates both the violence of separation and a newfound autonomy: Kahlo vowed to support herself financially after her divorce by selling her own work.
Personal isolation—its pain and its strength—is a recurring force across the sixty self-portraits Kahlo painted in her career and for which she became celebrated. “I paint self-portraits because I am so often alone,” Kahlo once explained, “because I am the person I know best.”

Though the Surrealists adopted Frida Kahlo as one of their own, the painter maintained that she did “not know if my paintings are Surrealist or not, but I do know that they are the most frank expression of myself.” She produced numerous self-portraits, each one an articulation of different facets of herself and her eventful life. Kahlo painted Self-Portrait with Cropped Hair in the wake of a particularly tumultuous time, just months after she divorced her famous husband, Mexican Muralist painter Diego Rivera. He had always admired her long, dark hair, which, as she indicates in the tresses littering the painting, she had cut off after their split. She shows herself in an oversized suit resembling the ones that Rivera wore. Through such emotionally and symbolically charged details, Kahlo expresses her feelings about her relationship with Rivera, while also asserting her sense of self as an independent artist.

John Kane,Self-Portrait,"Kane's 1929 Self-Portrait is considered one of the artist's masterpieces. The portrait is both a shockingly realistic depiction of the male body—veins, chest hair, and all—and an object meant for decorative display, with a frame indicated around the image edges and painted arches defining the figure's head. Kane produced most of his work in a concentrated period of time—the last seven years of his life.

Max Beckmann,Departure,"Across Departure’s three panels, Beckmann juxtaposed images of restraint and release, aggression and refuge, contraction and openness. While the work is a triptych—a format traditionally used (in Christian altarpieces, for example) to convey an explicit narrative or meaning—Departure’s symbolic message remains ambiguous. Bound, mutilated, blindfolded, or clamping their eyes shut, the figures in the outer panels are victims of sadistic violence. However, their circumstances are uncertain; perhaps they are actors on a stage, accompanied at left by such incongruous props as a tilted still life and a crystal ball. In the center, passengers from another time—a king and queen with a child, a warrior figure, and a sailor—stand solemnly on a barge gliding on calm seas. The blue sky and net teeming with fish suggest good fortune.
Beckmann painted Departure in a time of mounting terror and uncertainty, as Adolf Hitler gained power in the artist’s native Germany. The painting was completed over several years, during which the artist was dismissed from his teaching position in Frankfurt and forced to move to Berlin, then to Amsterdam. The Nazi party had deemed Beckmann’s art “degenerate,” and he was among hundreds of artists whose work was censored for alleged immoral or anti-German qualities. While the painting is widely considered a biographical response to this period, Beckmann asserted a universal message: “Departure bears no tendentious meaning—it could well be applied to all times.”

Although Beckmann denied that Departure carried any specific political content, the painting has come to be seen as one of the emblematic artistic responses to Hitler’s Germany. It was begun at the time that the Nazis fired Beckmann from his professorship at the Frankfurt Art Academy, and presages his forced emigration. Departure is the first of Beckmann’s several major paintings in the form of a triptych, a three-part format that recalls medieval or Renaissance altarpieces. The elaborate narrative includes scenes of sin and salvation, but what makes the painting modern is the deliberate ambiguity of its iconography. When the New York City art dealer who bought the painting in 1937 wrote to Beckmann to say that his visitors wanted specific explanations of the images, the artist replied ""if people cannot understand it of their own accord, . . . there is no sense in showing it.""

Jackson Pollock,"One: Number 31, 1950","One: Number 31, 1950, one of Pollock’s largest paintings, exemplifies his “drip” technique, in which he dropped, dribbled, or threw paint onto a canvas laid on the floor. His looping cords of color accordingly register force and speed yet are also graceful and lyrical, animating every inch of the composition. On the floor, Pollock said, “I am more at ease. I feel nearer, more a part of the painting since this way I can walk around it, work from the four sides and literally be in the painting.” Pollock’s process has been compared to the movements of a dance.

One: Number 31, 1950 exemplifies at a grand scale the radical “drip” technique that defined Pollock’s Abstract Expressionist style. Moving around an expanse of canvas laid on the floor, Pollock flung and poured ropes of paint across the surface. One is among the largest of his works that bear evidence of these dynamic gestures. The canvas pulses with energy: strings and skeins of enamel—some matte, some glossy—weave and run, an intricate web of tans, blues, and grays lashed through with black and white. The way the paint lies on the canvas suggests speed and force, and the image as a whole is dense and lush—yet its details have a delicacy and lyricism.
The Surrealists’ embrace of accident as a way to bypass the conscious mind sparked Pollock’s experiments with the chance effects of gravity and momentum on falling paint. However, although works like One have neither a single point of focus nor any obvious repetition or pattern, they sustain a sense of underlying order. This and the physicality of Pollock’s method have led to comparisons of his process with choreography, as if the works were the traces of a dance. Some see in paintings like One the nervous intensity of the modern city, others the primal rhythms of nature.

Florine Stettheimer,"Family Portrait, II","Dressed in a black pantsuit and with palette and paintbrush in hand, the artist appears at the far left side of this family portrait. She is joined by her mother, who sits upright in the golden armchair at right, and her sisters, Ettie and Carrie; the former reclines in the chair beside the artist, and the latter flanks the scene at the opposite end, a cigarette between her fingers. An artist, set designer, and poet, Stettheimer led a New York salon where she entertained her family and a close circle of artists, critics, and curators, exhibiting her work and sharing her poems.
Signs of her 1930s Manhattan milieu abound in this painting’s backdrop—an imagined skyline that features the Art Deco skyscraper at the heart of Rockefeller Center, known today as the Comcast Building, as well as Radio City Music Hall, the Chrysler Building, the Statue of Liberty, and a dragon-adorned decorative fragment from Alwyn Court, the midtown apartment building where the artist lived and worked. Overtaking these monumental and modern structures, Stettheimer depicted a trio of fantastically enormous blooming flowers at the painting’s center. She was unabashedly proud of this unconventional and personal portrait, frequently referring to the painting as “my masterpiece.”

Ernst Ludwig Kirchner,"Street, Dresden","Street, Dresden is Kirchner’s bold, discomfiting attempt to render the jarring experience of modern urban bustle. The scene radiates tension. Its packed pedestrians are locked in a constricting space; the plane of the sidewalk, in an unsettlingly intense pink (part of a palette of shrill and clashing colors), slopes steeply upward, and the exit to the rear is blocked by a trolley car. The street—Dresden’s fashionable Königstrasse—is crowded, even claustrophobically so, yet everyone seems alone. The women at right, one clutching her purse, the other her skirt, are holding themselves in, and their faces are expressionless, almost masklike. A little girl is dwarfed by her hat, one in a network of eddying, whorling shapes that entwine and enmesh the human figures.
Developing in parallel with the French Fauves, and influenced by them and by the Norwegian painter Edvard Munch, the German artists of Die Brücke (The Bridge), an association cofounded by Kirchner, explored the expressive possibilities of color, form, and composition in creating images of contemporary life. Street, Dresden is a bold expression of the intensity, dissonance, and anxiety of the modern city.

“The more I mixed with people the more I felt my loneliness,” Kirchner once wrote. Here he depicted Dresden’s fashionable Königstrasse as a place that is crowded yet in which everyone seems alone. The women on the right side of the composition stare vacantly ahead, their faces frighteningly masklike. A little girl moves awkwardly through the center. She is dwarfed by her large hat, one in a network of eddying shapes that radiate tension throughout the scene. Kirchner’s palette of shrill and clashing colors further intensifies the sense that both dynamism and alienation are, paradoxically, key characteristics of the modern urban experience.

The crowded city street—here, Dresden's fashionable Königstrasse—was a frequent subject for the German Expressionist group Die Brücke (The Bridge), an art collective Kirchner helped found in 1905. The group sought an authenticity of expression that its members felt had been lost with the innovations of modern life. Kirchner has violently heightened the colors of this urban scene, depicting its figures with masklike faces and vacant eyes in an attempt to capture the psychological alienation wrought by modernization. On the painting's reverse Kirchner painted a scene of nude women bathing in a natural landscape. Such idyllic scenes were frequent subjects for Die Brücke artists.

Paul Cézanne,Pines and Rocks (Fontainebleau?),"Unlike the expansive vistas often seen in landscape paintings, Cézanne's Pines and Rocks is a tightly framed, compressed view of nature. Low bushes and massive boulders form a bulwark against the forest, and a vertical line of pine trees extends upward, obscuring the sky beyond. Though the trees and rocks firmly structure the scene, Cézanne also infused Pines and Rocks with a sense of airiness and movement. Glimpses of bare, unfinished canvas peek through the dense weave of brushstrokes.
At first glance, Cézanne's palette seems limited to blues, greens, and browns, but a closer look reveals endless variations of colors, including shades of yellows, violets, and reds. At close range the painting appears nearly abstract—a dancing network of innumerable brushstrokes, some parallel, others looser and more rapidly applied. Stepping back, these varied marks coalesce into a shimmering effect that Cézanne called ""vibrations of light.""

Andrew Wyeth,Christina's World,"Set in the stark landscape of coastal Maine, Christina’s World depicts a young woman seen from behind, wearing a pink dress and lying in a grassy field. Although she appears to be in a position of repose, her torso, propped on her arms, is strangely alert; her silhouette is tense, almost frozen, giving the impression that she is fixed to the ground. She stares at a distant farmhouse and a group of outbuildings, ancient and grayed in harmony with the dry grass and overcast sky.
Wyeth’s neighbor Anna Christina Olson inspired the composition, which is one of four paint­ings by Wyeth in which she appears. As a young girl, Olson developed a degenerative muscle condition—possibly polio—that left her unable to walk. She refused to use a wheelchair, preferring to crawl, as depicted here, using her arms to drag her lower body along. “The challenge to me,” Wyeth explained, “was to do justice to her extraordinary conquest of a life which most people would consider hopeless.”
The high level of detail Wyeth gave to every object in his paintings encourages intense inspection, but his titles reveal the inner significance of their outwardly straightforward subjects. The title Christina’s World, courtesy of Wyeth’s wife, indicates that the painting is more a psychological landscape than a portrait, a portrayal of a state of mind rather than a place.

The woman crawling through the tawny grass was the artist's neighbor in Maine, who, crippled by polio, ""was limited physically but by no means spiritually."" Wyeth further explained, ""The challenge to me was to do justice to her extraordinary conquest of a life which most people would consider hopeless."" He recorded the arid landscape, rural house, and shacks with great detail, painting minute blades of grass, individual strands of hair, and nuances of light and shadow.

Paul Cézanne,Still Life with Apples,"Still Life with Apples demonstrates that the genre of still life can be a vehicle for faithfully representing not only objects but also the appearance of light and space. Painting from nature is not copying the object, Cézanne wrote, it is realizing ones sensations. He consistently drew attention to the quality of the paint and canvasnever aiming for illusion. For example, the edges of the fruit in the bowl are undefined and appear to shift. Rules of perspective, too, are broken; the right corner of the table tilts forward and is not aligned with the left side. Some areas of canvas are left bare, and others, like the drape of the tablecloth, appear unfinished. Still Life with Apples is more than an imitation of lifeit is an exploration of seeing and the very nature of painting.

Jacob Lawrence,"They arrived in great numbers into Chicago, the gateway of the West","In these works Lawrence focuses on the Great Migration, the exodus of African Americans from the rural South to northern and western cities beginning during World War I. The son of migrants himself, Lawrence researched extensively before starting to paint, distilling this relocation of millions into intimate vignettes. The series contains sixty panels in all, thirty of which appear here. Through an unusual decision to split the work in half, the Phillips Collection in Washington, DC, acquired the odd-numbered panels and MoMA the even-numbered ones. Using vibrant patterns, blocks of color, and pared-down, angular figures and forms, Lawrence tells a clear story of a historic event.

        Additional text






During the first half of the twentieth century, as the expanding modern industries in America’s northern cities demanded ever more workers, great numbers of African Americans saw a chance to escape the poverty and discrimination of the rural South. Between 1916 and 1930, more than a million people moved north. Lawrence’s parents made the journey, and he grew up hearing stories about it; as a young artist living in Harlem, the heart of New York’s African American community, he recognized it as an epic theme. Originally known as The Migration of the Negro but renamed by the artist in 1993, this cycle of sixty images—each accompanied by a caption written by the artist—chronicles a great exodus and arrival.
Visually, the cycle advances through panels of incident and panels of near abstraction and emptiness. Using exaggerated perspectives, rhythmic compositions, astringent colors, and angular figures, Lawrence bent decorative forms to the task of history, making social realism compatible with abstract art. African Americans met with a mixed reception in the North; along with jobs, the vote, and education, the new life brought unhealthy living conditions, civil unrest, and other trials, all documented in Lawrence’s cycle along with his community’s heroic perseverance in facing them.

During the first half of the twentieth century, as the expanding modern industries in America’s northern cities demanded ever more workers, great numbers of African Americans saw a chance to escape the poverty and discrimination of the rural South. Between 1916 and 1930, more than a million people moved north. Lawrence’s parents made the journey, and he grew up hearing stories about it; as a young artist living in Harlem, the heart of New York’s African American community, he recognized it as an epic theme. Originally known as The Migration of the Negro but renamed by the artist in 1993, this cycle of sixty images—each accompanied by a caption written by the artist—chronicles a great exodus and arrival.
Visually, the cycle advances through panels of incident and panels of near abstraction and emptiness. Using exaggerated perspectives, rhythmic compositions, astringent colors, and angular figures, Lawrence bent decorative forms to the task of history, making social realism compatible with abstract art. African Americans met with a mixed reception in the North; along with jobs, the vote, and education, the new life brought unhealthy living conditions, civil unrest, and other trials, all documented in Lawrence’s cycle along with his community’s heroic perseverance in facing them.

Man Ray (Emmanuel Radnitzky),The Rope Dancer Accompanies Herself with Her Shadows,"Man Ray became dissatisfied with his original composition for this work inspired by a tightrope performance he had seen in a vaudeville show. He had originally arranged pieces of colored paper cut into the shapes of the tightrope dancer’s acrobatic forms. Glancing down at the floor, he noticed that the discarded scraps of paper from which the shapes had been cut formed an abstract pattern resulting from chance. Comparing the accidental pattern with shadows that a dancer might have cast on the floor, he incorporated it into his composition.

Mark Rothko,No. 10,"Between 1949 and 1950, Rothko simplified the compositional structures of his earlier, Surrealist-inspired paintings to arrive at what would become his signature style. Here he divided the canvas horizontally into three dominant planes that softly merge into one another, their large passages of warm and cool colors creating a subtly pulsing field. Rothko wanted his paintings to awaken viewers to human emotion: “There is no such thing as good painting about nothing,” he argued. He also wanted viewers to get close to his paintings, becoming enveloped in their compositions and immersed in the emotions they expressed and evoked.

        Additional text






As refined and radical as was Rothko’s formal language, he saw his paintings as means to a much more essential end: to awaken viewers to the full force of human emotion. “There is no such thing as good painting about nothing,” he argued with fellow artist Adolph Gottlieb in 1943. “We assert that the subject is crucial and only that subject matter is valid which is tragic and timeless.” In No. 10, large passages of warm (yellow) and cool (blue, white, and gray) colors create a subtly pulsing field meant to envelop viewers. These effects reflect Rothko’s interest in the “push/pull” color theory of German painter Hans Hoffman, who described warm colors as appearing to advance (“push”) towards viewers and cool colors as appearing to recede (“pull”) away. Rothko wanted viewers to get close to his paintings, so that they would be dominated by his compositions and immersed in the emotions they expressed and evoked.

George Grosz,The Poet Max Herrmann-Neisse,"This is the second of two portraits George Grosz painted of his friend, writer Max Herrmann-Neisse. After countless hours in Grosz's studio, which yielded more than thirty preparatory drawings for the portraits, Herrmann-Neisse said he felt ""completely at home"" there. In this portrait, Herrmann-Neisse slumps deeply into a chair, lost in thought. Grosz meticulously yet sympathetically presents Herrmann-Neisse and his distinctive features, such as his hunchback and oversize bald head. The artist details the lines, bumps, veins, gnarls, and ruddiness of his friend's head and hands, placing him almost within arm's reach.
Grosz and Herrmann-Neisse shared the same politics, sense of humor, and cynical outlook. They were, as Herrmann-Neisse later recalled, both ""proper and anarchistic."" Herrmann-Neisse, Berlin's leading cabaret critic, guided the way in their nocturnal adventures. Together they dove into the seediest nightspots, while also moving in the same intellectual circles and contributing to the same periodicals.

Georgia O'Keeffe,Abstraction Blue,"“I decided to start anew,” Georgia O’Keeffe wrote to a friend in 1915, “to strip away what I had been taught—to accept as true my own thinking.” O’Keeffe’s statement reflects her transition from the naturalistic mode of representation she had been taught to abstraction in her painting. The development of this new style is evident in Abstraction Blue, completed twelve years later. The painting is dominated by undulating swirls and curves of blue tones emanating from the lower half of the canvas, bisected by a lighter crevice of paint that cuts the canvas vertically.

O’Keeffe decided as a child that she was going to be an artist when she grew up. Although she was unsure of what kind of art she would make, she later recalled, “I hadn’t a desire to make anything like the pictures I had seen.” Indeed, O’Keeffe’s long career was marked by ceaseless invention for which she received near constant acclaim, starting with her earliest paintings, which debuted in 1916 at New York’s famous 291 gallery, and continuing until her death, seven decades later, in 1986. In 1946 O’Keeffe was the subject of The Museum of Modern Art’s first retrospective exhibition devoted to a woman artist.
Although O’Keeffe is best known for figurative paintings of flowers, skulls, and the desert landscape of New Mexico, where she settled in 1946, the artist focused on abstract representation during the first phase of her career, from the 1910s into the ’30s. Abstraction Blue, from this period, exemplifies the freedom O’Keeffe felt and the possibilities she explored at this time through art’s most basic building blocks: “I found that I could say things with color and shapes that I couldn’t say in any other way—things I had no words for,” she explained.

Piet Mondrian,Broadway Boogie Woogie,"Mondrian arrived in New York in 1940, one of the many European artists who moved to the United States to escape World War II. He immediately fell in love with the city and with boogie-woogie music, to which he was introduced on his first evening in New York. Soon he began, as he said, to put a little boogie-woogie into his paintings.
Mondrian’s aesthetic doctrine of Neo-Plasticism restricted the painter to the most basic kinds of line—that is, to straight horizontals and verticals—and to a similarly limited color range, the primary triad of red, yellow, and blue plus white, black, and the grays in between. But Broadway Boogie Woogie omits black and breaks Mondrian’s once uniform bars of color into multicolored segments. Bouncing against each other, these tiny, blinking blocks of color create a vital and pulsing rhythm, an optical vibration that jumps from intersection to intersection like traffic on the streets of New York. At the same time, the picture is carefully calibrated, its colors interspersed with gray and white blocks.
Mondrian’s appreciation of boogie-woogie may have sprung partly from the fact that he saw its goals as analogous to his own: “destruction of melody which is the destruction of natural appearance; and construction through the continuous opposition of pure means— dynamic rhythm.”

Mondrian, who had escaped to New York from Europe after the outbreak of World War II, delighted in the city's architecture. He was also fascinated by American jazz, particularly boogie-woogie, finding its syncopated beat, irreverent approach to melody, and improvisational aesthetic akin to what he called, in his own work, the ""destruction of natural appearance; and construction through continuous opposition of pure means—dynamic rhythm."" In this painting, his penultimate, Mondrian replaced the black grid that had long governed his canvases with predominantly yellow lines that intersect at points marked by squares of blue and red. These atomized bands of stuttering chromatic pulses, interrupted by light gray, create paths across the canvas suggesting the city's grid, the movement of traffic, and blinking electric lights, as well as the rhythms of jazz.

New York, where Mondrian fled after the start of World War II, had a visible impact on his painting. He was inspired to rethink his work in his new context. Broadway Boogie Woogie, one of the last works he completed before his death, omits black and breaks his signature bars of color into multicolored segments. Bouncing against each other, the blocks of color in this painting create a pulsing rhythm, evincing a new dynamism in Mondrian’s work linked to his experience of New York and its jazz scene.

Jackson Pollock,"Number 1A, 1948","While the style of ""drip"" painting has become synonymous with the name Jackson Pollock, here the artist has autographed the work even more directly, with several handprints found at the composition's upper right. “Sometimes I use a brush but often prefer using a stick. Sometimes I pour the paint straight out of the can. I like to use a dripping, fluid paint.” Working on the floor in a spacious converted barn on Long Island, Pollock moved away from traditional artist’s oil paints and embraced lower viscosity commercial enamel paints.The fluidity of this paint allowed him to directly capture the movements of his entire body over the canvas. Around the same time, Pollock stopped giving his paintings evocative titles and began instead to number them. His wife, artist Lee Krasner, later explained, ""Numbers are neutral. They make people look at a painting for what it is—pure painting.""

Collectors did not immediately appreciate Pollock's radical new style, and when first exhibited, in 1949 (then titled Number 1, 1948), this painting remained unsold. Later that year the work was shown again in the artist’s second solo exhibition (Pollock added ""A"" to the title to avoid confusion with more recent work) and shortly thereafter was purchased by MoMA.

Helen Frankenthaler,Jacob's Ladder,"Taking up the drip technique developed by Jackson Pollock, in which the artist painted by dropping paint from above onto a canvas on the floor, Frankenthaler turned it to her own use, thinning her paints and using unprimed canvas so that the pigments would soak into the fabric rather than sit on the surface. The process is associated with abstract art, but this work, Frankenthaler explained, developed “into shapes symbolic of an exuberant figure and ladder, therefore Jacob’s Ladder,” a name derived from the Bible tale of Jacob’s dream of a ladder between heaven and earth.

        Additional text






As Frankenthaler worked on this painting, its forms came to suggest a ladderlike structure topped by what she called an “exuberant figure,” reminding her of the biblical narrative referred to in the work’s title. In the Old Testament Book of Genesis, the patriarch Jacob, while fleeing his murderous brother Esau, has a dream in which he envisions a ladder connecting the earth to heaven; God appears and issues a blessing and a pledge of devotion to Jacob and his descendants.
Frankenthaler evoked the symbolic features of the story through a combination of techniques that she had begun to employ in the 1950s. The image of a ladder emerged from a rectangular segment that Frankenthaler reinforced with relatively controlled, parallel brushstrokes, much the same way that the rungs of a ladder are constructed in real life. The “exuberant” aspects of the painting were applied more loosely, unbounded by contours. Frankenthaler used an unmediated process in these areas, allowing thinned oil paint to seep directly into unprimed canvas and yield chance effects produced by the pigment itself. Over the course of the next decade, Frankenthaler’s works would come to be marked by these sublime expanses of stained color, her signature contribution to the history of abstract painting.

Although it shares a name with the biblical tale of Jacob's dreamed ascent toward heaven, and also with an ancient Egyptian toy, Frankenthaler insisted this work had no illustrational intention: ""The picture developed (bit by bit while I was working on it) into shapes symbolic of an exuberant figure and ladder, therefore Jacob's Ladder."" Working in New York in the 1950s, Frankenthaler painted large-scale unprimed canvases on the floor to explore new ways of handling distinctively thinned paint. The artist said she borrowed from Jackson Pollock her ""concern with line, fluid line, calligraphy, and ... experiments with line not as line but as shape.""

Simon Hantaï,"Untitled [Suite ""Blancs""]","Hantaï executed this work using his signature method of “pliage,” or folding: he knotted parts of an unstretched canvas, brushed on paint, and then, once the acrylic had dried, untied the surface to reveal interplays of paint and ground. What looks like a playful image is in reality the chance outcome of a highly technical procedure. A mentor to artists such as Daniel Buren, whose work is also on view in this gallery, Hantaï developed an approach that combined features from diverse art movements, including Surrealism’s automatism—in which conscious control is surrendered—and Pop’s and Minimalism’s elimination of traces of the artist’s hand.

Henri Matisse,Gourds,"Describing Gourds in 1945, Matisse recalled that he had created ""a composition of objects that do not touch—but nonetheless participate in the same intimacy."" Its surface reveals that he achieved this effect after repeatedly adjusting and transposing forms. The austerity and monumentality of the canvas are complementary to The Moroccans, also of 1916. These qualities may have helped Matisse develop the luminous aspects of the larger canvas. In Gourds, he explained, he began ""to use pure black as a color of light and not as a color of darkness.""

Elizabeth Murray,Dis Pair,"Great blue ovals collide against stiff trapezoids, and twining yellow tendrils tie them all together: as abstract form, Dis Pair has a springy rhythmic dynamism. Yet it also applies the stylistic vocabulary of the comic strip to depicting a pair of shoes. Besides being wittily distorted and distended, these shoes are over ten feet high, using a strategy of enlargement preﬁgured in Claes Oldenburg’s Pop sculpture; and Pop art also anticipated Murray’s interest in the commonplaces of domestic life, which she painted on an undomestic, even heroic, scale. Murray dramatized the beautiful ordinariness of familiar objects. “I paint about the things that surround me,” she said, “things that I pick up and handle every day. That’s what art is. Art is an epiphany in a coffee cup.”
Standing out from the wall in relief, the surface of Dis Pair suggests a stretched and rounded skin—perhaps these curving forms humorously recall heads and faces, and their visual relationship that of a human couple. Its title puns on the word “despair,” playfully evoking a strained household bond.

Stuart Davis,Lucky Strike,"Davis typically painted local modern subjects in rhythmic compositions with bold colors. Among his sources of inspiration were “skyscraper architecture; the brilliant colors on gasoline stations; chain store fronts and taxicabs” and jazz music. Long before postwar artists mined the world of trademark brands, Davis incorporated imagery from logos, commercial signage, and packaging into his paintings, such as the branded bag of tobacco in Lucky Strike. Championed by the visionary dealer Edith Halpert at her Downtown Gallery, Davis’s work was met with both enthusiasm and confusion despite being engaged with the stuff and forms of modern life in New York in the 1920s.

René Magritte,The False Mirror,"A huge, isolated eye stares out at the viewer. Its left, inner corner has a vivid, viscous quality. The anatomical detailing of this area and its surface sheen contrast with the matte, dead-black of the eye’s pupil, which floats, unmoored, against a limpid, cloud-filled sky of cerulean blue. Although the areas surrounding the eye’s iris are carefully shaded and modeled, giving the illusion of a play of light on three-dimensional form, the sky displays no trace of convexity; its puffy clouds are beautifully rendered, but not its blue expanse. As a result, the sky appears as though seen through a circular window rather than mirrored in the spherical, liquid surface of an eye.
The eye was a subject that fascinated many Surrealist poets and visual artists, given its threshold position between inner, subjective self and the external world. The Surrealist photographer Man Ray once owned The False Mirror, which he memorably described as a painting that “sees as much as it itself is seen.” His words capture the work’s unsettling character: it places the viewer on the spot, caught between looking through and being watched by an eye that proves to be empty. It opens onto a void that, for all its radiant, cumulus-cloud-filled beauty, seems to deny the possibility of human existence.

Le Faux Miroir presents an enormous lashless eye with a luminous cloud-swept blue sky filling the iris and an opaque, dead-black disc for a pupil. The allusive title, provided by the Belgian Surrealist writer Paul Nougé, seems to insinuate limits to the authority of optical vision: a mirror provides a mechanical reflection, but the eye is selective and subjective. Magritte’s single eye functions on multiple enigmatic levels: the viewer both looks through it, as through a window, and is looked at by it, thus seeing and being seen simultaneously. The Surrealist photographer Man Ray, who owned the work from 1933 to 1936, recognized this compelling duality when he memorably described Le Faux Miroir as a painting that “sees as much as it itself is seen.”

Horace Pippin,"Abraham Lincoln, the Great Emancipator, Pardons the Sentry","Based in his hometown of West Chester, Pennsylvania, Pippin taught himself to paint, despite having suffered the partial paralysis of his right arm during World War I. The artist first rose to public acclaim when he was included in MoMA’s 1938 exhibition Masters of Popular Painting: Modern Primitives of Europe and America.
This work was painted in 1942, at the height of Pippin’s fame. It depicts an apocryphal Civil War tale in which President Lincoln pardoned a Union Army officer who had been condemned to death for falling asleep during the evening watch. Using a vivid palette and thickly brushed forms, Pippin created a dramatic nocturnal scene set inside a white tent, with stark shadows cast against its angled sides. Lincoln gently touches the back of the kneeling, white-shirted sentry, while General Ulysses S. Grant and two infantrymen bear witness. The title of the work alludes to the theme of emancipation—and indeed, the postures of Lincoln and the sentry recall popular images of the president gesturing over a kneeling freed slave. Pippin, however, reimagined this formula to feature a white protagonist who owes Lincoln his gratitude for a merciful pardon.

This painting’s title refers to Abraham Lincoln as the president who issued the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863, freeing America’s enslaved, but Pippin illustrated a different moment, a Civil War incident in which Lincoln pardoned a sentry condemned to death for sleeping on duty. In a Union Army tent, the sentry kneels before Lincoln while a general and two infantrymen bear witness. Pippin, an African American, was responding to a genre of images in which Black figures knelt before Lincoln in either supplication or gratitude for their freedom. In putting a white soldier in their place, Pippin subverted the familiar narrative to include white atonement.

Marc Chagall,I and the Village,"At the center of this painting, the faces of a goat and a man meet, their pupils connected by a faint and uneven white line. The contours of their noses, cheeks, and chins form the basis of a set of interlocking diagonals, concentric circles, planes of color, and fragmented forms. This central pair is joined by floating figures and vignettes that are interspersed, dreamlike, throughout the composition: at left, a woman milks a cow; above, a floating face appears in a church entrance; a row of houses features two that are upside down.
Chagall painted I and the Village one year after moving from Russia to Paris, where he joined a vibrant community of international artists known as La Ruche (The Beehive), so called for their proximity and productive exchange, which took place in the neighborhood of Montparnasse. Inspired in part by the recent development of Cubism, I and the Village displays Chagall’s distinct vocabulary of abstraction, characterized by fantastic colors and folkloric imagery drawn from memories of the artist’s Belarus home, a peasant town on the outskirts of Vitebsk. The title of this work, supplied by the poet Blaise Cendrars, Chagall’s close friend, evokes the relationship of the artist to his home and puns on the interpenetrating eyes of its central figures.

Chagall grew up in a Hasidic community in what is today Belarus. I and the Village, painted the year after he moved to Paris, expresses his memories of the place. He shows people and animals living side by side, their mutual dependence signified by the line connecting the eyes of peasant and cow. For the Hasidim, animals were humanity’s link to the universe, and the painting’s large circular forms suggest the orbiting sun, moon (in eclipse at the lower left), and earth. Chagall used lyrical colors and disjunctive geometries to render the scene nostalgic and magical.

Marcel Duchamp,3 Standard Stoppages,"It is “a joke about the meter,” Duchamp glibly noted about this piece, but his premise for it reads like a theorem: “If a straight horizontal thread one meter long falls from a height of one meter onto a horizontal plane twisting as it pleases [it] creates a new image of the unit of length.” Duchamp dropped three of these threads onto three stretched canvases, where they were then adhered, in order to preserve the random curves they assumed upon landing. The canvases were cut along those curves, creating a template for new units of measure that retain the meter’s length but undermine its rational basis.

A working note of Duchamp's describes his idea for this enigmatic work: ""A straight horizontal thread one meter long falls from a height of one meter onto a horizontal plane twisting as it pleases and creates a new image of the unit of length."" Here, three such threads, each fixed to its own canvas with varnish, and each canvas glued to its own glass panel, are enclosed in a box, along with three lengths of wood (draftsman's straightedges) cut into the shapes drawn by the three threads.
Duchamp later said that 3 Standard Stoppages opened the way ""to escape from those traditional methods of expression long associated with art,"" such as what Duchamp called ""retinal painting,"" art designed for the luxuriance of the eye. This required formal intelligence and a skillful hand on the part of the artist. The Stoppages, on the other hand, depended on chance—which, paradoxically, they at the same time fixed and ""standardized."" (Duchamp used the phrase ""canned chance."") Subordinating art both to accident and to something approximating the scientific method (which they simultaneously parodied), 3 Standard Stoppages advanced a conceptual approach, an absurdist strain, and a way of commenting on both art and the broader culture that inspired countless later artists of many different kinds.

Marcel Duchamp,"To Be Looked at (from the Other Side of the Glass) with One Eye, Close to, for Almost an Hour","The words forming this work’s title are inscribed (in French) on a strip of metal glued across the composition’s approximate center and appearing to invite viewers to look through a lens haloed by concentric circles and mounted between two panes of glass. Peering through the convex lens “for almost an hour” is supposed to have a hallucinatory effect as the view is dwarfed, flipped, and otherwise distorted. Duchamp delighted in the fact that the glass shattered while being transported, welcoming the mechanics of chance into the work.

Salvador Dalí,The Persistence of Memory,"Hard objects become inexplicably limp in this bleak and infinite dreamscape, while metal attracts ants like rotting flesh. Mastering what he called “the usual paralyzing tricks of eye-fooling,” Dalí painted with “the most imperialist fury of precision,” he said, but only “to systematize confusion and thus to help discredit completely the world of reality.” It is the classic Surrealist ambition, yet some literal reality is included, too: the distant golden cliffs are the coast of Catalonia, Dalí’s home.
Those limp watches are as soft as overripe cheese—indeed, they picture “the camembert of time,” in Dalí’s phrase. Here time must lose all meaning. Permanence goes with it: ants, a common theme in Dalí’s work, represent decay, particularly when they attack a gold watch, and they seem grotesquely organic. The monstrous fleshy creature draped across the painting’s center is at once alien and familiar: an approximation of Dalí’s own face in profile, its long eyelashes seem disturbingly insect-like or even sexual, as does what may or may not be a tongue oozing from its nose like a fat snail.
The year before this picture was painted, Dalí formulated his “paranoiac-critical method,” cultivating self-induced psychotic hallucinations in order to create art. “The difference between a madman and me,” he said, “is that I am not mad.”

Rufino Tamayo,Animals,"Painted on the eve of America's entry into World War II, while Tamayo was living in New York, this pair of snarling dogs captures, in the words of fellow Mexican painter Juan Soriano, ""that horror before a world that was turning to stone before our eyes."" Set against an eerily vacant yellow backdrop bathed in a red glow, the dogs, with their fangs bared, strike an anxious note, while the pale-blue bones near their paws suggest death or carnage. The subject matter was likely inspired not only by contemporary events but by pre-Columbian terracotta burial sculptures. In Aztec and Maya mythology, dogs were considered guides to the underworld, and statues of them were often buried with members of the ruling class.

Georges Braque,Man with a Guitar,"In this painting, the subject indicated by the title is barely decipherable: the figure has been broken into individual facets, to the point of its dispersal in space. Rendered in a limited palette of brown, green, and gray tones, the shapes seem to shift and interpenetrate, oscillating between surface and void before finally dissolving into an atmospheric background. Nevertheless, it is not an abstract picture. To keep the painting tethered to the real world, Braque included several identifiable details, such as the man’s profile at the top, a sharp angle that seems to represent the crook of his elbow, the guitar’s sound hole, and a realistically painted nail and coil of rope.
The artist began Man with a Guitar in the summer of 1911, a high moment in the development of the style that came to be known as Analytic Cubism. Rather than depict depth through traditional perspectival recession, Braque, together with Pablo Picasso, sought to create a new, nonnaturalistic vocabulary for articulating form, challenging the orthodoxy of illusionistic space in painting. Braque later recalled that in this intense period he and Picasso visited one another’s studios every day: they were “like mountain climbers roped together.”

Braque painted Man with a Guitar in a mode that came to be called Analytic Cubism. In works created in this style, he and Pablo Picasso experimented with different types of representation to challenge the orthodoxy of illusionistic space in painting. Here Braque paired an accessible, lifelike rendering of a nail and rope, at left, with a nearly indecipherable rendering of a human figure playing a guitar. Braque and Picasso's collaboration was so close when they developed Analytic Cubism that Braque later compared them to two mountaineers, bound together. In order to remove the mystique of the maker from their paintings, they both habitually signed the back of their works instead of the front.

Pablo Picasso,"""Ma Jolie""","“I love her very much and I will write this in my paintings,” Picasso, referring to his lover Marcelle Humbert, revealed in a letter. By inscribing “MA JOLIE” (my pretty one) on the bottom of this painting, the first of at least twelve works on which he did so, he privately referenced his nickname for Humbert while publicly alluding to the refrain of a popular music-hall song. These highly legible words, along with the nearby treble clef and musical staff, form a striking contrast to the near-indecipherable image of a figure that disappears into a network of flickering, semitransparent planes.

Ma jolie (My pretty girl) was the refrain of a popular song performed at a Parisian music hall Picasso frequented. The artist suggests this musical association by situating a treble clef and music staff near the bold, stenciled letters. Ma jolie was also Picasso's nickname for his lover Marcelle Humbert, whose figure he loosely built using the signature shifting planes of Analytic Cubism. This is far from a traditional portrait, but there are clues to its representational content. The central triangular mass subtly indicates the shape of a woman's head and torso, and a group of six vertical lines at the painting's lower center represent the strings of a guitar, which the woman strums. In Cubist works of this period, Picasso and Georges Braque employed multiple modes of representation simultaneously: here, Picasso combined language (in the black lettering), symbolic meaning (in the treble clef), and near abstraction (in the depiction of his subject).

		Gallery label from 2011.
	




Numerous elusive clues connect ""Ma Jolie"" to reality: a triangular form in the lower center, strung like a guitar or zither; below the strings, four fingers, with an angular elbow to the right; and in the upper half, perhaps a floating smile. Together these elements suggest a woman holding a musical instrument, but the picture hints at reality only to deny it. Planes, lines, spatial cues, shadings, and other traces of painting's language of illusion are abstracted from descriptive uses; the figure almost disappears into a network of flat, straight-edged, semitransparent planes.
Yet ""Ma Jolie,"" an example of high Analytic Cubism, is actually a painting on a very traditional theme—a woman holding a musical instrument. The palette of brown and sepia is reminiscent of the work of Rembrandt, and Picasso emphasizes the handmade nature of the brushstrokes, underlining the artist's human presence. At the bottom of the canvas Picasso also inscribes a treble clef and the words ""Ma Jolie,"" (my pretty one)—both a line from a popular song and a reference to his lover Marcelle Humbert. A kind of stand-in for the woman who can barely be seen, the phrase ""Ma Jolie"" is clear, legible, colloquial, and suggests conventional prettiness—although this was one of the most complex, abstract, and esoteric images of its day.

Fernand Léger,Three Women,"Three Women offers a machine-age update to a time-honored subject in the history of painting: the group portrait of female nudes in repose. In this monumental canvas, a self-possessed trio, flanked by a black dog, luxuriates around a coffee table in a chic, modern apartment. Their bodies consist of clusters of spheres and sharply contoured forms precisely shaded so that their silver and ocher skin as well as their slick, sideswept hair gleam like sheet metal. The features of these anonymous, impassive women, who gaze unflinchingly at the viewer, appear interchangeable, like mass-produced machine parts. The concatenation of bodies offsets a lushly vibrant domestic interior filled with brightly colored decor, stylized furniture, and an acutely slanted, dazzlingly patterned floor. The gridded background of interlocking angles and curvilinear forms gives the painting a shallow, mural-like appearance.
Léger had emerged from his experience as a combat engineer in the French army during World War I with a strong conviction in the beauty of modern machinery. The machinelike precision with which the figures in Three Women are rendered, and their seamless integration with their setting, reflects Léger’s singular vision of a harmonious reconciliation between man and machine in the modern era.

Henri Matisse,Dance (I),"Matisse created Dance (I) as a study for a painting commissioned by the Russian businessman and arts patron Sergei Shchukin. The final work and its pendant painting, *Music( (both completed in 1910), are housed in the collection of the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg. Dance (I) marks a moment in Matisse’s career when he embraced a reductive approach to painting, seeking the expressive potentials of fundamental elements: line, color, and form.
This daring approach was influenced by the increasing sophistication of photographic technology. In 1909 the artist observed, “The painter no longer has to preoccupy himself with details. The photograph is there to render the multitude of details a hundred times better and more quickly. Plastic form will present emotion as directly as possible and by the simplest means.” Across this monumental canvas Matisse used only four naturalistic colors: blue for the sky, green for the ground, and black and pale pink in rendering the five figures. Although he made adjustments to the composition, Matisse’s final lines convey a remarkable fluidity and sense of dynamic movement in their economical application—in the sweeping curve along the front side of the left figure, for example, and along the outstretched arms of the dancers as they come together in an unhampered expression of joy.

In March 1909, Matisse received a commission from the Russian businessman and collector Sergei Shchukin for two large decorative panels, Dance and Music (now in the Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg). He made this painting quickly as a compositional study for Dance, which was intended to hang on the landing of a staircase in Shchukin’s home. When it was painted, its simplification of the human body and radical elimination of perspective were attacked as inept or willfully crude, but Matisse felt that it evoked “life and rhythm.”

José Clemente Orozco,The Subway,"On his second stay in New York, Orozco made many works reflecting the city’s urban expansion and social dimension. The Subway presents several commuters on New York’s emblematic public transportation system, which first opened in 1904. The shadowy, stone-faced passengers impart a sense of melancholy to the scene, contrasting with the shiny train poles. A highly regarded artist in Mexico, Orozco struggled to find recognition in New York despite showing at several local galleries and completing a five-panel mural cycle at the New School in 1931.

David Alfaro Siqueiros,Collective Suicide,"Of Los tres grandes (The Big Three) Mexican muralists, Siqueiros was the youngest and the most politically radical. His artistic career was repeatedly interrupted by his fervent political activity and frequent imprisonment. He fought in the revolutionary army during the Mexican Revolution (1910–20), in the 1920s he organized a mineworkers union, in late 1936 he joined the republicans to fight against fascist forces in the Spanish Civil War (1936–39), and as an ardent Stalinist he helped orchestrate the unsuccessful assassination of Leon Trotsky in 1940.
Siqueiros was passionately committed to technical innovation. He believed that revolutionary art called for revolutionary techniques and materials and considered the paintbrush ""an implement of hair and wood in an age of steel."" Collective Suicide offers a compendium of the radical techniques the artist explored as part of the Siqueiros Experimental Workshop he founded in New York in 1936. He airbrushed paint across the top third of the panel and used stencils to depict the vast army of invading seventeenth-century Spanish conquistadors on horseback (lower right) and Chichimec Indians leaping to their deaths to avoid subjugation (left). The swirling vortexes are pools of fast-drying commercial lacquer typically used on cars. A member of the workshop later recalled that they applied this paint ""in thin glazes or built it up into thick gobs. We poured it, dripped it, splattered it, and hurled it at the picture surface."" Siqueiros's radical experiments proved influential for Abstract Expressionist artist Jackson Pollock, in particular, who was a member of the Workshop.

Collective Suicide is an apocalyptic vision of the Spanish conquest of Mexico. Siqueiros shows armored Spanish troops advancing on horseback, a bowed captive staggering before them in chains. The broken statue of a god demonstrates the ruin of the indigenous culture. Chichimec Indians, separated from their tormentors by a churning pit, slaughter their own children, hang themselves, stab themselves with spears, or hurl themselves from cliffs rather than submit to slavery.
Siqueiros, one of the Mexican mural painters of the 1920s and 1930s, advocated what he called “a monumental, heroic, and public art.” An activist and propagandist for social reform, he was politically minded even in his choices of materials and formats: rejecting what he called “bourgeois easel art,” he used commercial and industrial paints and methods. Collective Suicide is both a memorial to the doomed pre-Hispanic cultures of the Americas and a rallying cry against contemporary totalitarian regimes.

Lee Krasner,Gaea,"Krasner reinvented her artistic style several times during the course of her career. In the mid-1960s her work took on a spirit of free invention, embodied in broad, sweeping strokes of paint—quite different from her smaller, thickly painted, and tightly controlled canvases of the late 1940s. Though she painted abstractly, Krasner rejected the notion that her painting was devoid of content—she “wouldn’t dream of” creating a painting from a fully abstract idea, she said. In works like this one, titled after the Earth goddess of the ancient Greeks, the artist claimed to be “drawing from sources that are basic.”

This is one of several large horizontal paintings that Krasner made in the 1960s, late in her career, when she would often use her whole body to apply broad, sweeping strokes of paint to the canvas. Titled after the ancient Greek goddess of the earth, Gaea is composed of floral colors and organic, somersaulting shapes that reflect the artist's abiding fascination with the natural world and its primeval origins. Krasner reinvented her artistic style several times over the course of her career, struggling to pursue an artistic identity separate from her role as wife (or, after 1956, widow) and relentless champion of her husband, Jackson Pollock.

Francis Bacon,Painting,"Created in the immediate aftermath of World War II, Painting is an oblique but damning image of an anonymous public figure. The umbrella that partially obscures him might refer to Neville Chamberlain, the prewar British prime minister who was known for carrying one. His dark suit—the unofficial uniform of British politicians of the day—is punctuated by an incongruous bright yellow boutonniére, yet his deathly complexion and toothy grimace suggest a deep brutality beneath his proper exterior. In the background, three window shades evoke those found in an often-circulated photograph of Hitler's bunker, an image the artist included in multiple works. The sense of menace is accentuated by glaring colors and the cow carcasses suspended in a cruciform behind him, a motif drawn from Bacon's childhood fascination with butcher shops, but also a possible reference to Old Master treatments of the same subject.

Sigmar Polke,Watchtower,"The high scaffold in Watchtower could be a hunters' blind but also whispers of the guards' post—perhaps on the East-West border within a still-divided Germany, perhaps on a concentration-camp fence. Polke stenciled this skeletal frame in a series of paintings begun in 1984, varying the imagery around it. Here, he clothes the watchtower in a baleful phosphorescent glow, which sends up a hollow arm to catch the tower's top.
In the 1960s Polke had produced what he called ""Capitalist Realism,"" a German variant of Pop art. An element of Pop survives in Watchtower's support, made of commercial yard goods printed, respectively, with a cheerful floral and with a weave or mesh. Refusing consistency, however, Polke combines these with both the sinister tower image and an abstraction (which, with its alternately smooth and spidery lines, suggests more than one painting process). Images and styles from different eras, and associated with different moods and intentions, jostle and layer in the same work—a ""postmodern"" approach that Polke pioneered, and that a variety of artists explored in the 1980s.
Visual layering brings a layering of sense. In Watchtower, painted and printed images compete for visibility; if the watchtower is haunted and haunting, the prints connote a banal dailiness. It is as though different registers of consciousness and of memory were struggling for resolution.

When Polke made this painting, in 1984, he might have had in mind the hundreds of watchtowers that lined the Berlin Wall. He might also have been thinking of the towers circling the concentration camps of the Nazi era, forty years earlier; or of both. Polke’s surveillance tower is illuminated by a ghastly shimmer. It is painted, by stencil, on two swaths of cheap commercial fabric, one harsh and mechanical, the other gaudy and floral. Do these patterns respectively index the communist and the capitalist ideologies of the divided Germany after World War II? If so, neither is particularly alluring.

Barnett Newman,Vir Heroicus Sublimis,"The Latin title Vir Heroicus Sublimis can be translated “Man, heroic and sublime.” Newman once asked, “If we are living in a time without a legend that can be called sublime, how can we be creating sublime art?” This painting, his largest at the time, is one response. Newman wanted the viewer to stand close to this work, and he likened the experience to a human encounter: “It’s no different, really, from meeting another person. One has a reaction to the person physically. Also, there’s a metaphysical thing, and if a meeting of people is meaningful, it affects both their lives.”

It may appear that Newman concentrated on shape and color, but he insisted that his canvases were charged with symbolic meaning. Like Piet Mondrian and Kazimir Malevich before him, he believed in the spiritual content of abstract art. The very title of this painting—in English, “Man, heroic and sublime”—points to aspirations of transcendence.
Newman was one of several Abstract Expressionists who suppressed any signs of the action of the painter’s hand, preferring to work with broad, even expanses of deep color. In 1950 he moved into a new studio that afforded him the space to make this work, his first 8-by-18-foot painting and a radical shift in scale. Vir Heroicus Sublimis is so large that when the viewer stands close to it, as Newman intended, it creates an engulfing environment—a vast red field, broken by five thin vertical stripes. These stripes, or “zips,” as he called them, vary in width, color, and firmness of edge; the white zip at center left looks almost like a gap between separate planes, while the maroon zip to its right seems to recede slightly into the red. These starkly differentiated verticals create a division of the canvas that is surprisingly complex and asymmetrical. Dispersed throughout, they also act as markers in space and time as the viewer surveys the work.

Though his “drip paintings” brought him enormous critical and financial success, rather than continuing in this vein Pollock switched course. In 1951, he began a series of paintings that included Echo: Number 25, 1951. He reduced his palette solely to black and poured the enamel paint onto unprimed canvas with a slowness and control that resulted in compositions characterized more by delicacy and economy than by explosive, radiating energy. Even more radically, he re-introduced hints of figuration into these works, such as the eye that peers out from the upper-left corner of Echo, or the faces and bodies that emerge from his lines in the other canvases in this series. Pollock’s new direction confounded many admirers and critics. Anticipating this, he wrote to a friend, “[I] think the non-objectivists will find them disturbing,” yet his pared-down approach introduced a new creative pathway that helped lay the ground for Minimalism.

René Magritte,The Menaced Assassin,"The Menaced Assassin is one of Magritte's largest and most theatrical compositions. Magritte was an avid fan of the pre-World War I popular crime fiction series Fantômas; he borrowed the placement of the two detectives' figures flanking the door frame from the Le Mort Qui Tue (The Murderous Corpse), a film from the series first released in 1913. It was Magritte's ambition to create a similarly immersive and fantastical world on the canvas, here made manifest in the unsolvable narrative of this enduringly mysterious painting.

Edward Hopper,Night Windows,"Attending to private affairs in her apartment, the anonymous woman in Night Windows is unaware of any viewer's gaze. The painting exposes the voyeuristic opportunities of the modern American city, and the contradiction it offers between access to the intimate lives of strangers and urban loneliness and isolation. The city at night is a frequent subject in Hopper's work of the late 1920s and early '30s. Here, the composition of three windows allows for a dramatic setting of illuminated interior against dark night, a juxtaposition the artist identified as ""a common visual sensation.""

Henri Rousseau,The Dream,"“The woman asleep on the couch is dreaming she has been transported into the forest, listening to the sounds from the instrument of the enchanter,” Rousseau wrote of this enigmatic painting. He sought to explain his insertion of a musician and a reclining female nude into a moonlit jungle full of exotic foliage and wildlife. The setting was inspired by his visits to Paris’s Jardin des Plantes, a combined botanical garden and zoo. The self-taught painter was a crucial precedent for Surrealist artists like Salvador Dalí and René Magritte, who also relied on incongruous combinations and dream imagery to create mysterious, unforgettable pictures.

Although Rousseau completed more than twenty-five jungle paintings in his career, he never traveled outside France. He instead drew on images of the exotic as it was presented to the urban dweller through popular literature, colonial expositions, and the Paris Zoo. The lush jungle, wild animals, and mysterious horn player featured in this work were inspired by Rousseau's visits to the city's natural history museum and Jardin des plantes (a combined zoo and botanical garden). Of his visits the artist said, ""When I am in these hothouses and see the strange plants from exotic lands, it seems to me that I am entering a dream.""

Max Beckmann,Self-Portrait with a Cigarette,"This is one of many paintings and prints in which Beckmann used self-portraiture as a form of role playing. Here, he presented himself as a stern and successful businessman, holding a cigarette in a gesture of nonchalance or defiance. But at the lower left, almost imperceptible, is a red polkadot sash. A sly reference to the dress of a clown, it mocks and rebukes his mask of authority. Beckmann frequently portrayed himself in circus costume.

Joan Miró,The Birth of the World,"Miró painted this towering canvas in summer or fall of 1925 at his family’s farm in Montroig, a small village nestled between the mountains and coast of his native Catalonia. He was buoyed by the success of his recent exhibition in Paris, where he had been feted by many of the young poets and painters associated with the Surrealist movement. Their signatures emblazoned his exhibition’s invitation, claiming Miró as one of their own. The question after he returned to Spain was what he would do next. The Birth of the World is one of his answers.
With this work, Miró went, to quote a favorite Surrealist dictum, “beyond painting,” with “painting” understood to be his own past work and Western artistic tradition. He jettisoned the rules of perspective that painters had used since the Renaissance to construct illusionistic pictorial space, and instead he covered the ground of his vast canvas with an astonishing variety of abstract painterly incidents: spatters, smears, stains, drips, cascades, bursts, smudges, explosions, spurts, and diaphanous washes vie for attention with a series of minimal motifs that are as much drawn as painted. The result was a new and radically unconstrained form of painting that Miró would later describe as “a sort of genesis,” and that his Surrealist poet friends titled The Birth of the World.

Here Miró applied paint to an unevenly primed canvas in an unorthodox manner—pouring, brushing, and flinging—so that the paint soaked into the canvas in some places while resting on the surface in others. On top of this relatively uncontrolled application of paint, he added schematic lines and seemingly familiar shapes--a bird or kite, shooting star, balloon, and figure with white head--planned in preparatory studies. Miró once said that The Birth of the World describes ""a sort of genesis,"" an amorphous beginning out of which life may take form.

The boss, on horseback, wears an ochre uniform that blends with the colonial architecture in the background. Obin wrote “Ti Coyo faisant inspection” (Ti Coyo inspecting) at the bottom. Ti Coyo was probably known to everyone on F Street and beyond and is perhaps being satirized here as a snooty or cunning figure rather than a fearsome authority.

Paul Klee,Around the Fish,"Soon after the Nazis rose to power in 1933, Klee was suspended from his teaching position in Düsseldorf, leading him to return to his native Switzerland. This cryptic painting, in which a constellation of free-floating objects and symbols orbit an elaborately detailed fish, was among several of his works that the Nazi government included in their official “degenerate art” exhibitions and derided as childlike, disorderly, and confused. Yet it was precisely these qualities—the emulation of children’s art, the collage-like approach to building pictures, and the resistance to interpretation—that had attracted the Surrealists to Klee’s witty, lyrical artworks a decade earlier.

A garnished platter of fish is surrounded by a constellation of seemingly disparate elements—a cross, full and crescent moons, an exclamation point, a forked red flag—all hovering against a dark abyss. Some of Klee's iconography grew out of his teaching; the arrow, which he initially used as a teaching tool to indicate force and emotion for his students at the Bauhaus, here points confrontationally toward a stylized head, possibly alluding to human consciousness. Although they are often enigmatic, Klee believed his personal hieroglyphs and figurative elements had wide connotations: ""The object grows beyond its appearance through our knowledge of its inner being, through the knowledge that the thing is more than its outward aspect suggests.""

Henri Matisse,The Blue Window,"When this painting was first reproduced, in the May 1914 edition of the journal Les Soirées de Paris, it was titled La Glace sans tain, or ""the mirror without silvering,"" referring to a device known as a Claude mirror: the dark, red-framed square in the picture. Many artists used one of these slightly convex, dark-tinted mirrors to clarify their compositions; a scene reflected in it is less colorful than life, its compositional elements accentuated. Something close to that effect is visible here in the structured vertical and horizontal bands and the cool blue palette that Matisse painted over other layers of color, some of which are still visible. As he simplified forms he reinforced them with incising and scraping, in, for example, the cloud at top left.

Ernst Ludwig Kirchner,"Street, Berlin","Kirchner created this painting in a period of loneliness and insecurity shortly after the Brücke group disbanded in 1913. It shows two prostitutes strolling the streets, surrounded by furtively glancing men. For Kirchner, the prostitute was a symbol of the modern city, where glamour and danger, and intimacy and alienation necessarily coexisted, and everything was for sale. The intense, clashing colors heighten the excitement and anxiety, and the tilted horizon destabilizes the scene.

Frida Kahlo,Fulang-Chang and I,"Fulang-Chang and I depicts Kahlo with one of her pet monkeys, interpreted by many as surrogates for the children she and Diego Rivera were unable to conceive. The painting was included in the first major exhibition of her work, held at Julien Levy Gallery in New York in 1938. In the essay that accompanied the show, the Surrealist leader André Breton described Kahlo's work as ""a ribbon around a bomb"" and hailed her as a self-created Surrealist painter. Although she appreciated his enthusiasm for her work, Kahlo did not agree with his assessment: ""They thought I was a Surrealist but I wasn’t. I never painted dreams. I painted my own reality."" Kahlo later gave this painting to her close friend Mary Sklar, attaching a mirror to it so that, if Sklar chose, the two friends could be together.

Paul Klee,Cat and Bird,"Klee was one of the many modernist artists who wanted to practice what he called ""the pure cultivation of the means"" of painting—in other words, to use line, shape, and color for their own sake rather than to describe something visible. That priority freed him to create images dealing less with perception than with thought, so that the bird in this picture seems to fly not in front of the cat's forehead but inside it–the bird is literally on the cat's mind. Stressing this point by making the cat all head, Klee concentrates on thought, fantasy, appetite, the hungers of the brain. One of his aims as an artist, he said, was to ""make secret visions visible.""
The cat is watchful, frighteningly so, but it is also calm, and Klee's palette too is calm, in a narrow range from tawny to rose with zones of bluish green. This and the suggestion of a child's drawing lighten the air. Believing that children were close to the sources of creativity, Klee was fascinated by their art, and evokes it here through simple lines and shapes: ovals for the cat's eyes and pupils (and, more loosely, for the bird's body), triangles for its ears and nose. And the tip of that nose is a red heart, a sign of the cat's desire.

Henri Matisse,"The Swimming Pool, Maquette for ceramic (realized 1999 and 2005)","One summer morning in 1952, Matisse told his studio assistant and secretary Lydia Delectorskaya that “he wanted to see divers,” so they went to a favorite pool in Cannes. Suffering under the blazing sun, they returned home, and Matisse declared, “I will make myself my own pool.” He asked Delectorskaya to ring the walls of his dining room at the Hôtel Régina in Nice with a white paper band just above the level of his head, breaking only at window and doors at opposite ends of the room. Matisse cut divers, swimmers, and sea creatures out of paper painted ultramarine blue and pinned them onto the white paper.
The result was Matisse’s first and only self-contained, site-specific cut-out. Matisse saw in paper’s pliability an ideal match for the fluidity of water, making the piece a perfect synthesis of subject and means. With its simplification of forms, dynamic use of positives and negatives, and expansion across the walls, The Swimming Pool was the culmination of Matisse’s cut-paper work up to that point.

Arshile Gorky,Diary of a Seducer,"Painted primarily in shades of gray and divided roughly along its horizontal axis into a velvety upper expanse and a mostly lighter lower half, Diary of a Seducer evokes a landscape, even as Gorky’s sinuous drawing and a smattering of orifice-like ovals suggest a distinctly erotic context. Set within the shadowy, indeterminate space opened up visually by the artist’s thin washes of pigment and intermittently blurred lines, smoldering zones of yellow and burnt-orange paint evoke the heat of desire. Gorky’s handling insists equally on the literal constituents of painting, highlighting both the woven nature of his cloth support and the liquidity of oil—as evinced, for example, by the long, lone drip leading down to the artist’s signature at lower left.
Upon moving to New York in 1924, Gorky developed a style of painting that drew on the work of various prominent modern artists, including Pablo Picasso and Paul Cezanne. By the early 1940s, he had come in close contact with the Surrealist artists living in exile in the city, particularly the French writer André Breton. Gorky absorbed their aesthetic strategies and their interest in the subconscious while developing his own unique approach: rather than depicting recognizable imagery, his paintings are entirely abstract. As a result, Gorky’s work is often seen as a bridge between Surrealism and the Abstract Expressionism of the subsequent generation.

Henri Matisse,Composition,"Although Matisse's title for this canvas accentuates its abstractness, notes taken during a 1931 interview with the artist indicate that it represents a view from a curtained window in the artist’s home in Issy-les-Moulineaux, including the blue glass canopy that covered the front door:
The curtain was red, the color of the yellow [represents its] lining and the pattern [was] added by the artist. The green frame of the window suggests the green of the trees outside and the cool contrast of the green of the trees and the blue sky necessitated the large mass of yellow which to the artist signifies the vibration and pleasure he derived from the contrast of trees and sky. It is not therefore a completely abstract picture but a picture which has its roots in reality.
While most of Matisse’s paintings of this period are extensively revised, this canvas returns to an earlier mode of working. As he had in some of his Moroccan paintings of 1912–13, the artist drew the composition then filled it in with color to produce a sense of freshness and immediacy.

Joan Mitchell,Ladybug,"Mitchell’s Ladybug presents an apparently spontaneous—but in fact carefully plotted—accumulation of brushstrokes. Staccato arcs and dashes of marigold, mauve, dark berry, and brown seem to leap off the canvas, while excess pigment dribbles downward. Colors abut one another, overlap, and mix on the picture’s surface, dense paint merging with liquid drips, and flatness with relief. The chromatic web appears to hover over an empty ground, which is actually composed of several layers of white paint.
In 1957, the year in which she made Ladybug, Mitchell said of her process, “The freedom in my work is quite controlled.” She meticulously applied each color, attentive to the relationships between them and to the weight of each brushstroke. In this painting and others of this period, Mitchell, unlike many of her Abstract Expressionist contemporaries, rejected an allover compositional approach, preferring a balance of figure and ground—even in a fully abstract image.
Throughout her long career, Mitchell referred to the matter of her paintings as “feelings,” or memories of distinct times and places, the uneven flow of which she fixed in paint. Mitchell was thirty-two and living in New York when she painted Ladybug. Here, as in her other works, she aimed not to describe nature, but (as she put it) “to paint what it leaves me with.”

In Ladybug, Mitchell abuts pure colors with colors that mix on the canvas, dense paint with liquid drips, flatness with relief. White patches of pigment aerate the energized fields of color. Although Mitchell was considered one of the principal figures of the second generation of Abstract Expressionists that emerged in the mid-1950s, she also challenged the conventional wisdom of the New York School. While her paintings are abstract, their starting point was nature, which she set out not to describe but ""to paint what it leaves me with.""

Marcel Duchamp,Network of Stoppages,"In 3 Standard Stoppages, Duchamp had explored the possibility of adjusting the metric standard through a random procedure. In this large canvas he complicated that idea, multiplying the curves of the fallen threads from 3 Standard Stoppages by reproducing each one three times and positioning them in a diagrammatic arrangement. He also made the work by painting over the images on a canvas he had already used, those images being a female figure and a schematic, quasi-mechanical drawing of his ongoing project The Large Glass. The visible and semi-visible layers of Network of Stoppages seem to contrast three representational systems: traditional figuration, chance operations, and the diagram, which maps the world without picturing it.

Lichtenstein took the image for Girl with Ball straight from an advertisement, for a hotel in the Pocono Mountains. In pirating the image, however, he transformed it, submitting the ad's photograph to the techniques of the comic-strip artist and printer—and transforming those techniques, too, into a painter's versions of them. The resulting simplifications intensify the artifice of the picture, curdling its careful dream of fun in the sun. The girl's rounded mouth is more doll-like than female; any sex appeal she had has become as plastic as her beach ball.
In choosing the banal subject matter of paintings like Girl with Ball, Lichtenstein challenged the aesthetic orthodoxy of the time, still permeated by the spiritual and conceptual ambitions of Abstract Expressionism. The moral seriousness of art, and art's longevity, seemed foreign to this cheap, transient ad from the consumer marketplace, a sector of roiling turnover. Startling though the image was as an artwork, in fact, as advertising it was already old-fashioned—so that Lichtenstein's painting admits of a certain nostalgia. His simulation of printing similarly robs the technology of the polish it had already achieved: overstating the dots of the Benday process, and limiting his palette to primary colors, he exaggerates the limitations of mechanical reproduction, which becomes as much the subject of the painting as the girl herself.

Jackson Pollock,Stenographic Figure,"Much of Pollock's early work is characterized by a somber palette and congested pictorial space, but Stenographic Figure is bright and airy. Reflecting, perhaps, his new relationship with painter Lee Krasner, it is often read as a reclining female whose head in profile is at the upper left, whose arms and hands are opened wide over a torso that stretches across the middle of the canvas, and whose legs and paw-like feet are spread across the right edge. Another possible interpretation is that there is an upright figure near the right edge of the canvas and another just left of center. To finish the painting, Pollock covered the surface with a layer of scratchy, calligraphic lines.
When Stenographic Figure was first shown in 1943, at the Spring Salon for Young Artists held by Peggy Guggenheim at her gallery Art of This Century, it garnered praise from, among others, Dutch artist Piet Mondrian, who described it as “the most interesting work I’ve seen so far in America.”

A similar cast of eccentric characters—suggesting the awkward or, as Dunham puts it, ""bumpy"" nature of life—recur throughout his paintings from the past decade. Dunham began his career as an abstract painter in the early 1980s and quickly became a key figure in the medium's resurgence in the United States after decades dominated by Minimal and Conceptual sculpture and installation art. While he no longer works in a fully abstract mode, his process continues to be intuitive, guided by trial and error rather than premeditated subjects or themes. He recently described painting as ""a perfect storm of the crass, the sacred, and the intimately personal.""

In 1939 art collector and dealer Sidney Janis stumbled upon a painting by Morris Hirshfield tucked out of view in a New York gallery. He immediately asked to borrow two works by the artist to include in the exhibition Contemporary Unknown American Painters, which he was organizing for The Museum of Modern Art. This was the first public exposure for Hirshfield, a self-taught painter who had only begun making art after retiring at age sixty-five from a career in textile and shoe manufacturing. In 1941, Alfred H. Barr, Jr., MoMA's founding director, acquired Tiger and Girl in a Mirror for the Museum, and he organized a monographic exhibition of Hirshfield's work at MoMA two years later. In its early years the Museum was committed to collecting and exhibiting the work of self-taught artists, exploring and bringing to the public what Barr considered to be a ""tributary of one of the main streams of modern taste.""

Pablo Picasso,Les Demoiselles d'Avignon,"Les Demoiselles d’Avignon marks a radical break from traditional composition and perspective in painting. It depicts five naked women composed of flat, splintered planes whose faces were inspired by Iberian sculpture and African masks. The compressed space they inhabit appears to project forward in jagged shards, while a slice of melon in the still life at the bottom of the composition teeters on an upturned tabletop. Picasso unveiled the monumental painting in his Paris studio after months of revision. The Avignon of the work’s title is a reference to a street in Barcelona famed for its brothels.

        Additional text






This work is as uncomfortable to look at as it is impossible to look away from. No other painting in the history of Western art so boldly, and baldly, confronts the viewer. Three of the five naked protagonists stare outward, trapping us with their gazes, just as the picture’s complicated space, populated by bodies that simultaneously press against and recede from its surface, draws us in. Pictorial conventions are banished and idealized notions of beauty jettisoned. The two rightmost figures’ masklike features are often connected to Picasso’s visit, midway through his work on the painting, to the Musée d’Ethnographie du Trocadéro in Paris—the city’s first anthropological museum. There he had an epiphanic encounter with African and Oceanic art, which influenced the work’s ferocious antinaturalism—the degree to which the depicted figures resist mimetic norms.
Picasso produced an unprecedented quantity of preparatory drawings and paintings for Demoiselles. They speak to his struggle to reinvent Western painting in his own stylistically disjunctive, spatially contradictory, aggressively confrontational terms. The title Les Demoiselles d’Avignon (The women of Avignon) was given to the work around the time of its first public exhibition. It alludes to the prostitutes of Barcelona’s red-light district and foregrounds the psychosexual dimension and erotic content that conjoin with Demoiselles’s explosive form and fuel its continued ability to shock.

Gustav Klimt,"Hope, II","A pregnant woman bows her head and closes her eyes, as if praying for the safety of her child. Peeping out from behind her stomach is a death’s head, a looming sign of the danger she faces. At her feet, three women with lowered heads raise their hands, presumably also in prayer—although their solemnity might also imply mourning, as if they foresaw the child’s fate. Why, then, the painting’s title? Klimt himself called this work Vision, although he had titled an earlier, related painting of a pregnant woman Hope. By association with the earlier work, this one has become known as Hope, II.
Klimt was among the many European artists of his time who were inspired by cultural traditions from outside their own milieu. He lived in Vienna, a crossroads of East and West, and he drew on sources such as Byzantine art, Mycenaean metalwork, Persian rugs and miniatures, the mosaics of the Ravenna churches, and Japanese screens. In this painting, the woman’s gold-patterned robe—drawn flat, as clothing is in Russian icons, although her flesh is rounded and dimensional—has an extraordinary decorative beauty. Here birth, death, and the sensuality of the living exist side by side, suspended in equilibrium.

Inspired by the view from his window at the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum in Saint-Rémy, in southern France, where the artist spent twelve months in 1889–90 seeking reprieve from his mental illnesses, The Starry Night (made in mid-June) is both an exercise in observation and a clear departure from it. The vision took place at night, yet the painting, among hundreds of artworks van Gogh made that year, was created in several sessions during the day, under entirely different atmospheric conditions. The picturesque village nestled below the hills was based on other views—it could not be seen from his window—and the cypress at left appears much closer than it was. And although certain features of the sky have been reconstructed as observed, the artist altered celestial shapes and added a sense of glow.
Van Gogh assigned an emotional language to night and nature that took them far from their actual appearances. Dominated by vivid blues and yellows applied with gestural verve and immediacy, The Starry Night also demonstrates how inseparable van Gogh’s vision was from the new procedures of painting he had devised, in which color and paint describe a world outside the artwork even as they telegraph their own status as, merely, color and paint.

Vincent van Gogh produced emotional, visually arresting paintings over the course of a career that lasted only a decade. Nature, and the people living closely to it, first stirred his artistic inclinations and continued to inspire him throughout his short life. But rather than faithfully depicting his surroundings, he painted landscapes altered by his imagination. Van Gogh was seeking respite from plaguing depression at the Saint-Paul asylum in Saint-Rémy in southern France when he painted The Starry Night. It reflects his direct observations of his view of the countryside from his window as well as the memories and emotions this view evoked in him. The steeple of the church, for example, resembles those common in his native Netherlands, while the mountains in the background describe those in his surrounding landscape.

Andy Warhol,Campbell's Soup Cans,"When asked why he chose to paint Campbell’s soup cans, Warhol offered a deadpan reply: “I used to have the same lunch every day, for twenty years, I guess, the same thing over and over again.” That daily meal is the subject of this work consisting of thirty-two canvases—one for each of the flavors then sold by Campbell’s—using a combination of projection, tracing, painting, and stamping. Repeating the nearly identical image, the canvases at once stress the uniformity and ubiquity of the product’s packaging and subvert the idea of painting as a medium of invention and originality.

“I don’t think art should be only for the select few,” Warhol said. “I think it should be for the mass of the American people.” Like other Pop artists, Warhol used images with wide appeal: comic strips, advertisements, photographs of rock-music icons and movie stars, and tabloid news shots. In Campbell’s Soup Cans he reproduced an object of mass consumption in the most literal sense. When he ﬁrst exhibited these canvases—there are thirty-two of them, the number of soup varieties Campbell’s then sold—each one simultaneously hung from the wall, like a painting, and stood on a shelf, like groceries in a store. The artist referred to them affectionately as “portraits.”
Warhol made these paintings in a systematic multistep process. First he delineated each can with pencil on canvas. Next he painted the can and label by hand, using a light projector to superimpose the lettering directly onto the canvas, then tracing its form. Repeating the nearly identical image at the same scale, the canvases stress the uniformity and pervasiveness of the Campbell’s can, thereby challenging the prevailing idea of painting as a medium of invention and originality distinct from popular culture. The Campbell’s label, which had not changed in more than ﬁfty years, was unremarkable and ubiquitous. Warhol later said of Campbell’s soup, “I used to drink it. I used to have the same lunch every day, for twenty years, I guess, the same thing over and over again.”

Willem de Kooning,Woman I,"“Flesh is the reason oil paint was invented,” de Kooning once remarked, and although he painted many abstractions he continually returned to the figure. Woman I took him an unusually long time to complete: he made numerous preliminary studies, then repainted the canvas repeatedly, eventually arriving at this figure of a woman, the first of a series. Some saw the painting as a betrayal, a regression to an outmoded figurative tradition. Others have called it misogynistic, understanding it as objectifying and violent. De Kooning himself said, however, “Beauty becomes petulant to me. I like the grotesque. It’s more joyous.”

Woman I is the first in the group of Woman paintings that de Kooning began in 1950. The works are influenced by sources ranging from Paleolithic fertility fetishes to American billboard advertisements, and the attributes of this particular figure seem to include both the vengeful power of the goddess and the hollow seductiveness of the calendar pinup. Rejecting traditional representations of women, which he summarized as “the idol, the Venus, the nude,” de Kooning painted a figure with gigantic eyes, massive breasts, and a toothy grin. Her threatening stare and ferocious smile are heightened by the artist’s aggressive brushwork and frenetic application of paint. Her body is outlined in thick and thin black lines, which continue in loops and streaks and drips, taking on a life of their own. Abrupt, angular strokes of orange, blue, yellow, and green piled up in multiple directions as layers of color were applied, scraped away, and restored. De Kooning took an unusually long time to complete this work, making numerous preliminary studies and repainting it repeatedly.
In the early 1950s, artists and critics championing abstraction had declared the human figure obsolete in painting. Instead of abandoning the figure, however, de Kooning revisited this age-old subject through the sweeping brushwork of Abstract Expressionism, the prevailing contemporary style. He famously declared, “Flesh is the reason oil paint was invented.”

Agnes Martin,Friendship,"Spanning just over six feet on each side, Friendship is one of three paintings Martin made with gold leaf and gesso, materials rich with historical associations that stand out in an era defined by commercial images and industrial production. Though the painting’s lavish gold-leaf medium is unique within Martin’s body of work, its format—a square canvas, covered from edge to edge with a meticulous grid—had become the painter’s hallmark by the early 1960s. Martin would continue to explore this abstract geometric language throughout her long career, initially in New York and later in Taos, New Mexico, where she settled in 1968.
Though she often showed with other New York abstractionists, Martin charted new terrain outside both the broad gestural vocabulary of Abstract Expressionism and the systematic repe­titions of Minimalism. Her practice was tethered to spirituality and drew from a mix of ideas stemming from Zen Buddhism and American Transcendentalism, a nineteenth-century move­ment that emphasized the power of individuality and the importance of nature. Painting is “a world without objects, without interruption . . . or obstacle,” Martin said. “It is to accept the necessity of . . . going into a field of vision as you would cross an empty beach to look at the ocean.”

Andy Warhol,S&H Green Stamps,"S&H Green Stamps showcases Warhol's career–long fascination with ready–made, reproducible imagery. To create the painting Warhol hand stamped an image of an S & H Green Stamp trading coupon in three successive layers (light green, dark green, and red) using silkscreen ink. This labor–intensive three–step stamping process mimicked the more efficient process of screenprinting, which Warhol would employ in the months to follow. The lack of a focal point in the work pays tribute to the allover compositions of Jackson Pollock and other Abstract Expressionists, but with its banal motif and repetitive imagery S&H Green Stamps embodies a witty reproach to the grand and heroic canvases of these artists. This work featuring stamps, itself stamped into existence, exemplifies the artist’s sly, deadpan sense of humor.

Norman Lewis,Phantasy II,"After beginning his career as a figurative painter, in 1946 Lewis announced that he wanted to break away from what he called “stagnation in too much tradition.” The art and writings of the Russian painter Vasily Kandinsky (1866–1944), one of the first modern artists to create abstract paintings, were one inspiration. Like his New York peers of this period, Lewis was deeply interested in music, which influenced the painting of Phantasy II. Lewis’s boldly colored lines and forms are akin to the improvisational structures of jazz.

Hector Hyppolite,The Congo Queen,"Hector Hyppolite is considered the grand maître of Haitian art. At the age of 52, encouraged by the Haitian novelist Philippe Thoby-Marcelin, he moved to Port-au-Prince and joined the Centre d’Art, a cooperative founded in 1944 by the American painter DeWitt Peters. The Congo Queen shows Hyppolite’s deftness in conflating Haitian Vodou imagery and Roman Catholic iconography. The central figure, a veiled woman holding an infant on her lap, recalls portrayals of the Madonna and Child, especially the Black Madonna of Czestochowa in Poland. However, as the title indicates, the subject is Erzulie Dantor, the fierce protector of women and children in Haitian mythology. The deity, here shown with a stern gaze and flanked by a pair of wary seraphim, was among Hyppolite’s most popular subjects. To achieve the painting’s wide range of textures, the artist used brushes and chicken feathers as well as his fingers.

Pablo Picasso,Boy Leading a Horse,"Picasso developed this painting from the central motif of an unrealized mural of four mounted riders and a walking figure leading a horse. Determinedly striding forward, the youth seen here exudes confidence, his clenched fist compelling the slender steed to follow him without any reins. The vigorous mark-making, relative lack of fine details, and shifting hues of browns and grays all speak to an evolution in Picasso’s art. But this subdued palette and restrained expressivity would soon be broken by the artist’s radical Cubist explorations in the ensuing years.

Edward Hopper,Gas,"This work resulted from a composite representation of several gasoline stations seen by the artist. The light in this painting—both natural and artificial—gives the scene of a gas station and its lone attendant at dusk an underlying sense of drama. But rather than simply depicting a straightforward narrative, Hopper's aim was ""the most exact transcription possible of my most intimate impressions of nature""—in this case, the loneliness of an American country road.

Henri Matisse,"Study for ""Luxe, calme et volupté""","Matisse painted this oil sketch in the summer of 1904, while working alongside fellow artist Paul Signac on the French Riviera, and he completed the final painting (now at the Musée d'Orsay, Paris) the following winter. Both Signac and Matisse were influenced by the elder painter Paul Cézanne, whose discrete strokes of color emphasized the materiality of the painted surface over naturalistic illusion. But Matisse went further, using a palette of pure, high-pitched colors (blue, green, yellow, and orange) to render the landscape, and outlining the figures in blue. The painting takes its title from a line by the nineteenth-century poet Charles Baudelaire and shares the poems subject of an escape to an imaginary, tranquil refuge.

Oskar Schlemmer,Bauhaus Stairway,"The Bauhaus school was premised on a utopian vision of society based on the integration of tech­nology, art, design, and life. Originally founded in 1919 by architect Walter Gropius in Weimar, Germany, the school moved to Dessau in 1925 and finally to Berlin in 1932. Schlemmer, who taught at the school from 1920 to 1929, made Bauhaus Stairway in response to an announcement that, under pressure from the Nazi party, the school was to close. The Bauhaus shut its doors in 1933, the year after he created this painting.
Best known as a choreographer and as the director of the Bauhaus theater workshop, Schlemmer dedicated his life’s work to investigating the relationships between the human body and its surrounding space. Bauhaus Stairway depicts these interactions in the contrast between static architectural forms and dynamically shifting figures, epitomized by the dancer balancing en pointe. Schlemmer’s bodies are composed of cones, spheres, and cylinders—simplified into almost modular geometric units rather than rendered as individual identities. The three central figures are pictured from behind; those whose faces we do see reveal no expression or emotion. The streamlined bodies on this pivoting staircase seem to move away from us—as if marking the turning point between past hopes and a dark future.

Bauhaus Stairway depicts the Bauhaus, a school founded in 1919 by architect Walter Gropius, famous for its visionary integration of technology, art, and design. Although Schlemmer made this painting three years after he left his teaching position at the Bauhaus, the works gridded structure, streamlined modular bodies and predominant palette of primary colors capture the schools vibrant design spirit. The carefully choreographed arrangement of the figures and the man en pointe at the top of the stairs reflects Schlemmers role as the creator of many important dance and theatrical productions at the Bauhaus. Schlemmer painted this work as Hitler assumed power, shortly before the Nazis closed the Bauhaus for good. He was among many artists persecuted by the Nazis, whose work they deemed ""degenerate"" and often destroyed.

The colorful concentric circles and circuitous lines that compose this painting evolved from Tanaka's performance Electric Dress, premiered a decade before, in which she wore two hundred blinking incandescent lightbulbs and tubes covered with red, blue, yellow, and green enamel paint.

Yves Klein,Blue Monochrome,"Klein famously declared the blue sky to be his first artwork and from there continued finding radical new ways to represent the infinite and immaterial in his works. One such strategy was monochrome abstraction—the use of one color over an entire canvas. Klein saw monochrome painting as an “open window to freedom, as the possibility of being immersed in the immeasurable existence of color.” Although he used a range of colors, his most iconic works often featured International Klein Blue, a shade of pure ultramarine that Klein claimed to have invented and trademarked. He used materials like water, fire, and air to construct his works and staged a “leap into the void” for a self-published newspaper.

        Additional text






Blue Monochrome is one from a dizzying array of innovations that Klein pursued in order to cultivate a new aesthetic consciousness. Undivided by drawing and seemingly untouched by the artist’s hand, the radiant field frees color from the confines of form. That liberation extends to International Klein Blue, the medium Klein developed with a chemist: pure color powder in a lightweight, virtually invisible resin solution that grants the individual grains unprecedented autonomy, rather than pigment bound with oil, which had a dulling effect the artist dreaded. Applied evenly with a roller, the profound hue suggests a potentially infinite visual expansion—an impression further encouraged by Blue Monochrome’s generous dimensions and subtly softened corners, which Klein carefully rounded. Yet the minutely textured matte surface also exerts a powerful attraction in its own right.
Klein proposed that art was evolving toward the immaterial, progressively leaving behind physical objects in favor of impalpable effects and feats of ideation, and he conceived his intensely ultramarine canvases as essential stations on this path. This exploration also included ephemeral performances with the paint-smeared models that he called “living paintbrushes” and the sale, via certificate, of otherwise intangible “zones of immaterial sensibility.” At the same time, Klein acknowledged the allure of sensual immediacy, noting, “The more one lives in the immaterial, the more one loves matter.”

Monochrome abstraction—the use of one color over an entire canvas—has been a strategy adopted by many painters wishing to challenge expectations of what an image can and should represent. Klein likened monochrome painting to an ""open window to freedom."" He worked with a chemist to develop his own particular brand of blue. Made from pure color pigment and a binding medium, it is called International Klein Blue. Klein adopted this hue as a means of evoking the immateriality and boundlessness of his own particular utopian vision of the world.

Vasily Kandinsky,Picture with an Archer,"Kandinsky studied law and economics and cultivated an interest in ethnography before fully committing himself to his art at the age of thirty. His academic pursuits brought him to Russia’s remote northwestern regions, where he became immersed in the folk art traditions of his homeland. There he encountered Siberian shamans who used wooden horses, often fashioned from birch branches carved to resemble a horse’s head, to transcend time and space and travel to other worlds.
In Picture with an Archer, an ocher horse leaps into a sumptuous chorus of colors. Its rider twists to point his bow at some threat beyond the frame, gazing back while galloping forward into a sweeping landscape of viridians, blues, and crimson reds. To the left, figures process from a distant cluster of buildings, whose forms resonate with the trees and strange rock formations that appear in this dreamlike scene.
For Kandinsky, the motif of the horse and rider alluded to shamanism as well as to medieval knights and religious icons. It also came to represent spiritual triumph over materialism, aligning with his belief that color and form possessed their own affective power that acted on the viewer independently of images and objects. While still discernible, Kandinsky’s archer charges into a realm where recognizable imagery dissolves into planes of color, and line flows freely. Four years later, in 1913, he would produce his first truly abstract works.

This painting’s vibrant colors almost obscure its subject. At lower right an archer on horseback leaps through a radiant landscape of towering trees and rock formations. Men in Russian dress stand in the left foreground; behind them is a group of buildings with onion-shaped domes. This folkloric scene evokes Kandinsky’s native Russia, and it also bears the influence of Murnau, the southern German town where the artist lived when he made this work: the black outlines enclosing bright colors recall reverse glass painting, a local craft. “Color,” Kandinsky wrote a year later, “is a power which directly influences the soul.”

Long before Andy Warhol and other Pop artists mined the world of trademark brands, Davis incorporated imagery from logos, commercial signage, and modern packaging into his paintings.

Oskar Kokoschka,Hans Tietze and Erica Tietze-Conrat,"In 1909 the Viennese art historians Hans and Erica Tietze asked the twenty-three year-old Kokoschka to paint a marriage portrait for their mantelpiece. Mrs. Tietze recalled that she and her husband were painted individually, a fact suggested by their separate poses and gazes. Kokoschka used thin layers of color to create the hazy atmosphere surrounding the couple, and added a sense of crackling energy by scratching the paint with his fingernails. The Museum bought this painting from the Tietzes in 1939, just one year after the couple immigrated to New York.

The Tietzes were socially prominent art historians, but Kokoschka ignores their public personas to find a mysterious delicacy in their private relationship. Erica gazes out toward us; Hans looks at Erica's hand, and reaches for it without touching it, so that his hands and her left arm form an arch that is broken at its summit by a narrow gap, a space with a psychic charge. The couple emerge from a shimmering ground of russets and dim blues into which their outlines seem to melt in places. Scratches in the thin oil—made, according to Erica Tietze—Conrat, with the artist's fingernails-create a texture of ghostly half-marks around the figures, a subtle halo of crackling energy.
Like his Viennese compatriot Egon Schiele, Kokoschka tried to transcend academic formulas with an art of emotional and physical immediacy-an art, in his words, ""to render the vision of people being alive."" Hans Tietze and Erica Tietze-Conrat is one of his ""black portraits,"" in which he tried to penetrate his subjects' ""closed personalities so full of tension."" (His Vienna was also the home of Sigmund Freud.)

Barnett Newman,Abraham,"Roughly the size of a tall man, Abraham is a dark painting with a black zip placed off-center on a brown field. The figure-ground relationship between zip and field is ambiguous, and the work therefore reads almost as a solid slab. Newman compared the experience of viewing it to that of confronting another man head-on. Since his breakthrough with Onement, I, he felt that he had thrown off the burdens of art history—including notions of compositional order and pictorial space—and forged a new beginning for painting. He saw abstraction as a language: while his paintings lacked what art historian Meyer Schapiro termed “object matter” (recognizable images), for Newman they expressed the highest metaphysical and spiritual themes, or, in Schapiro’s terms, “subject matter.” This is true of Abraham, whose title evokes both Newman’s own father and the Old Testament father who nearly sacrificed his son to God.

Clyfford Still,1944-N No. 2,"Painting 1944-N is a powerful early example of Still's mature style. The surface is a black impasto, enlivened with knife marks. A jagged red line cuts high on the canvas, and is intersected by two vertical, irregular, pointed shapes before plunging downward to the bottom edge. The size of paintings like this one, its largely empty expanse, and the lightning-bolt quality of Still's line have led some to see in his work a vision of the broad spaces of the Western prairies, where he grew up. But he himself believed that such associations only diminished his work.
Still commanded a new kind of abstraction, free from decipherable symbols. The tarry surface of Painting 1944-N concentrates attention on itself, denying the illusion of depth, and the intensely saturated hue carries emotional force without relying on associative imagery. More programmatically than any of the other Abstract Expressionists, Still consciously tried to erase any traces of modern European art from his painting, and to develop a new art appropriate to the New World. ""Pigment on canvas,"" he believed, ""has a way of initiating conventional reactions. . . . Behind these reactions is a body of history matured into dogma, authority, tradition. The totalitarian hegemony of this tradition I despise, its presumptions I reject.""

Claude Monet,Water Lilies,"In the final decades of his life, Monet embarked on a series of monumental compositions depicting the lush lily ponds in his gardens in Giverny, in northwestern France. At the end of the nineteenth century, the painter had envisioned a circular installation of vast paintings—he called them *grandes décorations*—that would envelop the viewer in an expanse of water, flora, and sky. This vision materialized in the form of some forty large-scale panels, Water Lilies among them, that Monet produced and continuously reworked from 1914 until his death in 1926.
At this triptych’s center, lilies bloom in a luminous pool of green and blue that is frothed with lavender-tinged reflections of clouds. Thick strokes in darker shades seep into the left panel, while on the right, sky and water are gently swallowed by an expanse of reddish-green vegetation. The dense composition hovers at the threshold of abstraction, its lack of horizon creating an effect of total immersion. After Monet’s death, twenty-two panels were installed on curved walls in the Musée de l’Orangerie in Paris: a gift from the artist to the nation of France. The remaining canvases stayed in his studios until the late 1940s, when collectors and MoMA curators began to take an interest in them.

Alfonso Ossorio,Empty Chair or The Last Colonial,"Candy-colored plastics and glass lure us to discover shells, nails, bones, and even weapons embedded in this complex assemblage. Prosthetic eyes stare back at us, and two small wooden figurines flank a central “empty chair.” Ossorio began making assemblages like this one around 1960. A decade earlier, he had taken his first trip since childhood to his native Philippines, an experience that led him to explore deeply the imagery of Western religion and Indigenous tradition. A naturalized American citizen, the artist confronted the violent history of Catholicism and colonialism, both in the Philippines and the United States. Empty Chair or The Last Colonial brings together found objects of indeterminate origin and a surreal mix of natural and artificial materials— evoking an unsettling array of relics, icons, curios, and totems, as if vestiges of a collision of cultures.

Robert Ryman,Twin,"“I don’t think of myself as making white paintings,” Ryman said. “I make paintings; I’m a painter. White paint is my medium.” This statement conveys the radical practice that the artist began in the mid-1960s—one that narrowed the focus of his work to white paint alone. In Twin, the surface of the canvas is covered in tightly tiered rows of white brushstrokes pulled in one motion across an unprimed canvas. Its scale required the use of a specially made twelve-inch brush and thinned paint so that Ryman could complete each horizontal stroke without interruption.

Ad Reinhardt,Number 107,"This painting is one of several monochromes in which Reinhardt explored the use of a vertical format. The combination of the white paint with the natural color of the underlying canvas emphasizes the composition's tonal variations. The rough-edged, horizontal brushstrokes of varying length and paint saturation create a bricklike pattern that is at once structured and painterly. Reinhardt developed these brick forms with greater linearity and modularity in paintings such as Abstract Painting (Blue) of 1953.

While his New York School peers Willem de Kooning and Jackson Pollock used gestural painting techniques, Reinhardt’s work of the 1950s deliberately lacks both the physically aggressive handling of paint and the hot emotion characteristic of these artists. This attitude may be seen in the increasing austerity of his paintings and in the restrained brushwork of Number 107. The painting is one of a number of monochromes he produced in the 1950s, for which he explored a vertical format. Working in white over an off-white ground, Reinhardt fosters subtle chromatic variations by adding solvent to his paint, alternating opaque with translucent passages, and creating a bricklike pattern of horizontal brushstrokes that is both structured and painterly.

Pablo Picasso,Bather,"Though traditional painting captures a fixed moment from a single perspective, Picasso endeavored to depict this bather from the front, rear, and side simultaneously. In doing so, he used the nude figure standing at the seaside as a testing ground for new representational possibilities, challenging pictorial conventions of space, beauty, and time. The bather’s body is an amalgam of discrete shapes: her breasts, stomach, and shoulders are formed by curves and jags. The painting’s background is further simplified into three bands of color applied in flat, rough strokes representing sand, sea, and sky.

In Bather, Picasso used a nude female figure standing at the seaside as a testing ground for new representational possibilities, challenging pictorial conventions of space, beauty, and time. The background is simplified into three bands of color applied in flat, rough strokes. The bather’s body is broken into discrete parts; her breasts, stomach, and shoulders are hardened into geometric arcs and curves, and her right foot twists unnaturally. Traditional painting captures a single moment from a single perspective; Picasso depicted his bather’s torso from the front, rear, and side, presenting multiple views simultaneously.

Bridget Riley,Fission,"The distortion of the black dots at this painting's center creates the optical illusion that the image surface is caving in. In this and other early works, Riley wanted to activate the relationship between the viewer and the work. As the title implies, the surface seems to be folding or opening, suggesting that the viewer could be swallowed up by it. While the black dots on the white surface don’t depict something or tell a story, as in a traditional painting, the sense of space this painting creates is not unlike the illusion created by the use of traditional linear perspective.

Kazimir Malevich,Suprematist Composition: White on White,"A white square floating weightlessly in a white field, Suprematist Composition: White on White was one of the most radical paintings of its day: a geometric abstraction without reference to external reality. Yet the picture is not impersonal: we see the artist’s hand in the texture of the paint and in the subtle variations of the whites. The square is not exactly symmetrical, and its lines, imprecisely ruled, have a breathing quality, generating a feeling not of borders defining a shape but of a space without limits.
Malevich was fascinated with technology and particularly with the airplane. He studied aerial photography and wanted White on White to create a sense of floating and transcendence. White, Malevich believed, was the color of infinity and signified a realm of higher feeling, a utopian world of pure form that was attainable only through nonobjective art. Indeed, he named his theory of art Suprematism to signify “the supremacy of pure feeling or perception in the pictorial arts”; and pure perception, he wrote, demanded that a picture’s forms “have nothing in common with nature.” In 1918, soon after the Russian Revolution, the connotations of this sense of liberation were not only aesthetic but also social and political. Malevich expressed his exhilaration in a manifesto one year later: “I have overcome the lining of the colored sky. . . . Swim in the white free abyss, infinity is before you.”

Malevich described his aesthetic theory, known as Suprematism, as ""the supremacy of pure feeling or perception in the pictorial arts."" He viewed the Russian Revolution as having paved the way for a new society in which materialism would eventually lead to spiritual freedom. This austere painting counts among the most radical paintings of its day, yet it is not impersonal; the trace of the artist's hand is visible in the texture of the paint and the subtle variations of white. The imprecise outlines of the asymmetrical square generate a feeling of infinite space rather than definite borders.

With his White on White series Malevich pushed the limits of abstraction to an unprecedented degree. Reducing pictorial means to their bare minimum, he not only dispensed with the illusion of depth and volume but also rid painting of its seemingly last essential attribute, color. What remains is a geometric figure, barely differentiated from a slightly warmer white ground and given the illusion of movement by its skewed and off-center position. With its richly textured surface and delicate brushwork, Suprematist Composition: White on White emphasizes painting’s material aspects, and its simplicity suggests a radical reinvention of the medium. In 1918, a year after the Russian Revolution, the connotations of this sense of liberation were not only aesthetic but sociopolitical. Malevich expressed his exhilaration in a manifesto published in conjunction with the first public exhibition of the series, in Moscow in 1919: ""I have overcome the lining of the colored sky. . . . Swim in the white free abyss, infinity is before you.""

Paul Klee,Mask of Fear,"This curious personage, with four small spindly legs supporting a visage of stunned eyes and a quizzical smirk or handlebar moustache, offers a satiric take on the work's grim title. Inspired by a Zuni war god sculpture that Klee saw at an ethnological museum, it was painted on the eve of Hitler's assumption of power in Germany, a year after Klee left the Bauhaus for a professorship at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf. The two sets of legs suggest that two figures might be supporting and hiding behind this monumental carnival-style mask, an arrangement related to Klee's metaphorical statement, ""The mask represents art, and behind it hides man.""

Giorgio de Chirico,The Song of Love,"“M. Giorgio de Chirico has just bought a pink rubber glove”—so wrote the French poet Guillaume Apollinaire in July of 1914, noting the purchase because, he went on to say, he knew the glove’s appearance in de Chirico’s paintings would add to the works’ uncanny power. Implying human presence, as a mold of the hand, yet also inhuman, a clammily limp fragment distinctly unfleshlike in color, the glove in The Song of Love has an unsettling authority. Why is this surgical garment pinned to a board or canvas, alongside a plaster head copied from a classical statue, a relic of a noble vanished age? What is the meaning of the green ball? And what is the whole ensemble doing in the outdoor setting insinuated by the building and the passing train?
Unlikely meetings among dissimilar objects were to become a strong theme in modern art (they would be an explicit goal of the Surrealists, for whom de Chirico’s work was influential), but de Chirico sought more than surprise: in works like this one, for which Apollinaire used the term “metaphysical,” his aim was to express something of the reality he saw hidden beyond outward appearances. Cloaked in an atmosphere of anxiety and melancholy, de Chirico’s humanoid forms, vacuous architecture, shadowy passages, and eerily elongated streets evoke the profound absurdity of a universe torn apart by World War I.

Ellsworth Kelly,Colors for a Large Wall,"At the time of its production in 1951, Colors for a Large Wall was the largest painting Kelly had ever made. It brings together four strategies fundamental to modernism: the additive composition of similar elements (each square is painted separately), the use of chance (each square is arranged randomly), the idea of the readymade (each color was taken from the French craft paper Kelly used to produce the collage on which the painting is based), and the allover grid of its composition. The result is a painting in which no aspect of its appearance has been determined by the artist’s personal choices.

“I have never been interested in painterliness,” Kelly said, using “painterliness” to mean “a very personal handwriting, putting marks on a canvas.” There is no personal handwriting, nor even any marks as such, in Colors for a Large Wall, which comprises sixty-four abutting canvases, each the same size (a fraction under a foot square) and each painted a single color. Not even the colors themselves, or their position in relation to each other, could be called personal; Kelly derived them from commercial colored papers, and their sequence is arbitrary.
Kelly made Colors for a Large Wall while living in Paris, where he worked from 1948 to 1954. While there he began introducing elements of chance into his compositions, one of several strategies he deployed to create what he called “anonymous” works. Produced at the height of Abstract Expressionism, this work has that style’s mural scale, and Kelly thought deeply about the relationship of painting to architecture: he saw it as one of figure and ground, with the wall as background and the painting as a figure set upon it. Unlike the Abstract Expressionists, however, Kelly resolutely suppressed the presence of painterly gesture. “I want to eliminate the ‘I made this’ from my work,” he declared.

Kelly arranged the sixty–four square panels of the grid in an arbitrary sequence, likening his method to the ""the work of a bricklayer."" Using squares of commercial colored paper left over from a previous series of collages, he first made a study for Colors for a Large Wall. Then he precisely matched the hues of the papers with oil paint, and arranged the final, full–size panels in strict adherence to the paper study.

Mark Rothko,No. 5/No.,"The rectangles within this painting do not extend to the edges of the canvas and appear to hover just over its surface. Heightening this sensation is the effect of chromatic afterimage. Staring at each colored segment individually affects the perception of those adjacent to it. The red–orange center of the painting tints the yellow above it with just a bit of green. The yellow above seems to tint the orange with blue. Despite these color relationships, Rothko did not want his pictures appreciated solely for their spectral qualities. He said, ""If you are only moved by color relationships, then you miss the point. I'm interested in expressing the big emotions—tragedy, ecstasy, doom.""

Edvard Munch,The Storm,"The setting of The Storm is the Norwegian seaside village of Åsgårdstrand, where Munch often spent his summers. The main figure and the group behind her cover their ears to keep out the sound of the storm’s howling winds. This painting was made the same year Munch originated the motif of The Scream. Here the depiction is more naturalistic, and the characters are female rather than male, but the compositions both reflect Munch’s preoccupation with the concept of a solitary individual set apart from a community of others

        Additional text






Munch painted The Storm in Åsgårdstrand, a small Norwegian seaside resort where he often stayed. There had indeed been a violent storm there that summer, but the painting does not appear to show it, or even its physical aftermath; the storm here is an inner one, a psychic distress. Standing near the water, in an eerie blue half–light, half–dark Scandinavian summer night, a young woman clasps her hands to her head. Other women, standing apart from her, make the same anguished gesture—to what end we are not sure. The circle in which they stand, and the protagonist's white dress, give to the scene the feeling of some ancient pagan ritual, even while the solid house in the background, its lit windows shining in the dark, suggests some more regular life from which these women are excluded—or perhaps that they find intolerable.
Munch's art suggests a transformation of personal memories and emotions into a realm of dream, myth, and enigma. His exposure to French Symbolist poetry during a stay in Paris had convinced him of the necessity for a more subjective art; there was no need, he said, for more paintings of ""people who read and women who knit."" Associated with the international development of Symbolism in the 1890s, he is also recognized as a precursor of Expressionism.

Isamu Noguchi,Even the Centipede,"When Noguchi made this work he was living in Japan, where, he would recall, “Our house was filled with [centipedes]. I became rather fond of them. . . . When you kill a centipede, the two halves just walk off. This gave me the idea for a sculpture in sections.” The work’s clay elements invoke Japan’s long tradition of ceramics. In memorializing and monumentalizing the centipede, Noguchi was addressing the Buddhist notion of respect for all living things. “The work is a shrine to the centipede,” he said, “or rather the centipede is now enshrined at The Museum of Modern Art.”

Louise Bourgeois,Sleeping Figure,"Though Bourgeois has described Sleeping Figure as ""a war figure that cannot face the world and is defensive,"" likening its face to a mask and its arms to lances, the work's narrow, tapered shape suggests vulnerability and its jutting limbs seem to support rather than defend its body. Sleeping Figure belongs to The Personages, a group of more than eighty totemic wood sculptures the artist made in New York between 1945 and 1950. Bourgeois has characterized these works as surrogates for the family and friends she left behind in France when she moved to New York in 1938.
Although she was never formally part of the Paris-based group, Bourgeois knew many Surrealist poets and artists and shared their interest in primitive art and the unconscious. In spite of these affinities, her work can be understood as a rejection of the male-dominated movement. While the form of this figure is phallic, its gender is ambiguous—a departure from Surrealism's objectification and fragmentation of female bodies.

Henri Matisse,The Back (I),"Matisse began Back, his largest sculpture to date, in spring 1908 in his studio in Paris and worked on it for over a year, keeping the clay wet in order to do so. In June 1909, as he prepared to move to his new studio in the Paris suburb of Issy-les-Moulineaux, he cast the relief in plaster, thereby destroying the original. Now working in plaster, he changed his methods, adding fresh material to the hard, rewetted surface and removing hardened forms with chisels, hammers, and rasps. Matisse returned to Back several times over the next twenty-one years, each time beginning with a plaster cast of the previous state. He also preserved a plaster version of each state, and, cast in bronze, they are the works we know today—Back (I), Back (II), Back (III), and Back (IV).

Henri Matisse,The Back (III),"""Fit your parts into one another and build up your figure as a carpenter does a house. Everything must be constructed—built up of parts that make a unit; a tree like a human body, a human body like a cathedral."" So Matisse believed the sculptor should proceed, and the credo can be sensed in this work and throughout the group of four relief sculptures to which it belongs, with its progressive stability and simplicity. Matisse did not conceive The Backs as a series, but occasionally returned to the theme over the years. Even so, these reliefs—his largest sculptures—present a coherent progress, from a relatively detailed naturalism toward a near-abstract monumentality.
This work is the third in the series, and it is more vertical and less sinuous than its precursors. The first work in the series (1909) has a dynamic tension, and an arabesque line flows through it; in the second (1913), the body is more erect, less fluid. The left leg has become a thick pillar; making the figure more solid. The third work leads to the fourth (1931), where Matisse suppresses physical detail, making the contours more fluid, the surface more homogeneous. But if he surrenders expressiveness in the sculpture's parts, he regains it in the symmetrical harmony of the work as a whole.

Henri Matisse,The Back (IV),"At the end of 1917 Matisse settled in Nice, where he spent most of each year for the remainder of his long life. In the decades that followed he did not forget his period of extreme experimentation. Around 1931 Matisse returned to Back. The final state, made from a cast of Back (III), is a starkly refined, highly architectural monolith in which the struggles of the earlier states have been smoothed away. Matisse kept a plaster version of Back (IV) in his studio for the rest of his life, and it is visible in photographs with his late, monumental paper cutouts (below), which—like his works of 1913–17—combine pictorial and sculptural characteristics. All four Backs were unique plaster bas-reliefs until 1950, when Back (I), (III), and (IV) were cast in bronze; Back (II) was not discovered until 1955, a year after the artist’s death, and it was cast a year later.

Over the summer of 1916 Matisse brought many of his most ambitious works to conclusion, including Jeannette (V). Its severity and formal and psychological concentration set it apart from its predecessors, but these qualities open onto something more extreme—a primal, atavistic power well beyond the traditional protocols of portraiture. Matisse began Jeannette (V) from the plaster cast of Jeannette (III) rather than the more recent Jeannette (IV), perhaps imagining it as an alternate final composition. He removed the clump of hair while adding mass to the brow, carving lines from the hairline down the bust, and elongating the neck. The compacted mass and weight of the forms produce a dense, unified final work.

Louise Nevelson,Hanging Column (from Dawn's Wedding Feast),"These two Hanging Column sculptures are parts of a room-sized work, Dawn's Wedding Feast that Nevelson created for MoMA’s 1959–60 exhibition 16 Americans. Each of its components represents an aspect of a wedding ceremony: four wall sculptures stand for chapels, smaller pieces for objects in a trousseau, vertical structures for the bride and groom, and these hanging structures for guests. The artist, who often professed an aversion to marriage, pieced together discarded wood, such as broken moldings and finials, and then painted the assemblages a uniform color. Her use of white—a departure from her usual black—underlines the nuptial theme. Although Nevelson wished for the ensemble to remain intact, its parts have entered various collections.

Scott Burton,Pair of Rock Chairs,"From behind, these sculptures resemble nothing so much as half-buried boulders, or the tips of submerged outcrops of living rock. It is only from the front that they show the results of human artifice: two simple cuts, one horizontal, one vertical. In each stone the result is a flat and ample ledge with an upright back—an invitation to sit.
The opportunity extended by Pair of Rock Chairs is actually not only physical but social, for two seats will tempt two people to rest and talk. Burton had a deep interest in social exchange—in fact, his first artworks were performances in front of an audience. His sculpture developed out of the furniture he used as props in these performances, and always remains part furniture, undermining the common notion that art is somehow separate from everyday life. Burton admired the Russian Constructivist artists who, earlier in the century, had linked innovative forms to a concern with their practical social applications. The natural shapes of these chairs, and their beautiful surface—variously rough and smooth, and veined in gray and white—inject aesthetic pleasure into their obvious usefulness.

Salvador Dalí,The Little Theater,"This illuminated, diorama-like construction contains eleven parallel painted-glass panels. Both pictorial illusion and actual depth produce the sense of receding space, from the proscenium arch on the front panel to the sky on the furthest, with various bizarre objects, figures, and scenarios sandwiched in-between. This unusual work may have been Dalí’s attempt to recreate “a large square box” he had seen as a boy: “It was a kind of optical theater, which provided me with the greatest measure of illusion of my childhood. I have never been able to determine or reconstruct in my mind exactly what it was like.”

This sculpture—part theatrical maquette, part multi-layered painting—is composed of eleven painted glass panes that juxtapose several distinct and peculiar worlds. At the margins the proscenium arch, receding stage floor, and inkwell evoke the stage and an unseen playwright, highlighting the orchestrated, artificial character of painting. Behind these Dalí contrasts an idyllic Arcadian scene with a barren, ruined landscape. Dalí's unique construction was inspired by his longstanding fascination with optical devices and with the theater.

Alberto Giacometti,The Palace at 4 a.m.,"In the Surrealist periodical Minotaure, Giacometti described the process that brought into being this fragile, air-filled sculpture. “This object formed little by little toward the end of summer 1932,” Giacometti recalled; “it gradually became clearer to me, the various parts taking their exact form and their particular place in the ensemble. Come autumn it had attained such a reality that its execution did not take me more than one day.” By privileging an interior mental image over the physical act of making, Giacometti affirmed his commitment to Surrealism’s call for the near-automatic recording of visions achieved in a dreamlike state.
Within his palace’s spindly, tenuously defined spaces, a slender sheet of suspended glass connects its rooms from left to right, adding to the structure’s vulnerable appearance. At right a delicate bird skeleton and sinuously curving vertebrae float, suspended, in space-frames or cages; at left a chess piece–like figure of a woman stands before three panels; at center is an enigmatic elliptical shape that the artist identified with himself. In the Minotaure account, Giacometti compared the whole to a “fragile palace of matches” that he and a woman he loved would build every night, only to watch it repeatedly collapse. His words give voice to key Surrealist preoccupations, including all-consuming desire, the power of memory, and the relationship between Eros and Thanatos—love and death.

In 1933, Giacometti published a statement describing his artistic process, referring specifically to works like The Palace at 4 A.M. ""For many years I have executed only sculptures that have presented themselves to my mind entirely completed. I have limited myself to reproducing them in space without changing anything, without asking myself what they could mean.... The attempts to which I have sometimes given way, of conscious realization of a picture or even a sculpture, have always failed."" This work with its spindly wood scaffolding, sheet of glass, and delicate skeletons is a vertical, immaterial drawing in space.

According to Giacometti, The Palace at 4 a.m. relates to ""a period of six months passed in the presence of a woman who, concentrating all life in herself, transported my every moment into a state of enchantment. We constructed a fantastical palace in the night—a very fragile palace of matches. At the least false movement a whole section would collapse. We always began it again."" The woman in question is often identified as one of Giacometti's lovers, known only by her first name, Denise. In the summer of 1933 Giacometti told André Breton, the leader of the Surrealist movement, that he was incapable of making anything that did not have something to do with her.

Jackie Winsor,Burnt Piece,"Winsor's use of a cube can be seen in relation to Minimalist sculpture of the 1960s; however, she undermined this basic form by setting the cement, wood, and wire mesh structure over a bonfire. She burned the cube for about five hours, until, she has said, it ""began to expand and round slightly. As it cooled later, it contracted and the cube became slightly concave. During the firing, fragments of concrete popped off the main body to a distance of twenty feet. I had researched the material's properties because I wanted to push it to its structural limit, to where the concrete was actively, dangerously, responding to the heat but was not overwhelmed or destroyed. . . . That is what physically happened to the form and material. That is its history.""

A member of the post-Minimalist generation, Winsor inherits the Minimalists' preference for simple geometric shapes. But her works are handmade, and their surfaces are more various and tactile than Minimalism's impersonal, machine-honed planes. They also show slotlike openings that invite us to peer into their dark interiors: ""You go up to the windowed cubes and touch them,"" says Winsor, ""you peek, you use your eyes, your nose."" In this way ""the cubes parallel and are metaphors for the body.""
For Burnt Piece Winsor built a cube out of wood and wire-reinforced concrete. Then she set this cube over a bonfire, burning away the wood and turning the concrete brown, black, and ash gray. This volatile process has created a dramatic narrative. Winsor burned the cube for about five hours, until, she says, it ""began to expand and round slightly. As it cooled later, it contracted and the cube became slightly concave. During the firing, fragments of concrete popped off the main body to a distance of twenty feet. I had researched the material's properties because I wanted to push to its structural limit, to where the concrete was actively, dangerously, responding to the heat but was not overwhelmed or destroyed. . . .

Constantin Brâncuși,Blond Negress II,"The polished bronze head of Blond Negress II sits at eye level atop a multipart base made of carved wood, limestone, and marble elements; all four of Brancusi’s most-used materials. The series to which the sculpture belongs was initiated in 1923 with a white marble version titled White Negress I, allegedly inspired by an African woman Brancusi saw at a colonial fair in Marseilles in 1922. Many artists working in Paris during the 1920s, including Pablo Picasso, borrowed heavily from non-Western art, particularly art from various regions in Africa. Like many of Brancusi’s sculptures,Blond Negress II departs from the realism typical to most conventional Western sculpture of the period. Even so, his work is still a portrait, since it is based on a particular person, though a nameless one.

Meret Oppenheim,Object,"Oppenheim’s fur-lined teacup is perhaps the single most notorious Surrealist object. Its subtle perversity was inspired by a conversation between Oppenheim, Pablo Picasso, and the photographer Dora Maar at a Paris café. Admiring Oppenheim’s fur-trimmed bracelets, Picasso remarked that one could cover just about anything with fur. “Even this cup and saucer,” Oppenheim replied.
In the 1930s, many Surrealist artists were arranging found objects in bizarre combinations that challenged reason and summoned unconscious and poetic associations. Object —titled Le Déjeuner en fourrure (Lunch in fur) by the Surrealist leader André Breton—is a cup-and-saucer set that was purchased at a Paris department store and lined with the pelt of a Chinese gazelle. The work highlights the specificities of sensual pleasure: fur may delight the touch, but it repels the tongue. And a cup and spoon, of course, are made to be put in the mouth.
Following his inclusion of the work in MoMA’s 1936–37 exhibition Fantastic Art, Dada, Surrealism, Alfred H. Barr, Jr., the Museum’s director, remarked, “Few works of art in recent years have so captured the popular imagination.... The ‘fur-lined tea set’ makes concretely real the most extreme, the most bizarre improbability. The tension and excitement caused by this object in the minds of tens of thousands of Americans have been expressed in rage, laughter, disgust or delight.”

Carlos Rojas,Study for Monument to Evita Peron,"Although Rojas was a proponent of abstraction, he was also interested in questions of cultural identity, especially in Latin America. This sculpture references the late Argentine First Lady Eva Perón (1919–52), a cult figure who attracted Rojas for her enduring prominence in the leftist political imagination. Despite its title, this work was conceived not for an official monument but as a philosophical exercise. “I think that I will always keep asking myself about Evita Perón, her meaning and reality,” said Rojas. “What is Marilyn Monroe? What is Jacqueline? What is Brigitte Bardot? What is ‘Monument for Evita Perón?’”

Constantin Brâncuși,Maiastra,"Maiastra is a towering sculpture, more than seven feet tall, with four distinct parts. The lower sections are made of limestone and comprise two rectilinear blocks separated by a roughly hewn carving that Brancusi exhibited in 1908 as an independent sculpture, titled Double Caryatid. Perched atop this tower, a marble bird—the magical Romanian fairy-tale creature for which the sculpture is named—is reduced to its defining characteristics: ovoid body, elongated neck, beak, and plume of tail feathers. Maiastra is Brancusi’s first work to feature a bird, a subject to which he would return throughout his career.
As a composite of disparate elements, Maiastra is exemplary of the artist’s practice. Brancusi believed that the base was a crucial component of a sculpture, and in making many of his works he experimented with a variety of bases until arriving at a combination of elements he found satisfying, often documenting the work photographically along the way. In Maiastra the rounded, smoothly polished surface of the marble bird contrasts sharply with both the stark angularity of the limestone blocks and the coarsely textured schematic carving of Double Caryatid. For the artist, this juxtaposition of materials and methods embodied the perpetual dialogue between the spiritual dimension and everyday reality.

For Maiastra, his first sculpture of a bird, Brancusi made a streamlined form that accentuates the bird’s long neck, swelling chest, and tail feathers. Its regal elegance suits its namesake, a mythical creature from the folklore of the artist’s native Romania. The bird sits perched on a three-part limestone base, whose central component began as an independent sculpture, Double Caryatid (a caryatid being an architectural support carved as a human figure). Maiastra marks the first time Brancusi incorporated an existing sculpture into a pedestal, a practice he would continue throughout his career.

Maiastra is Brancusi’s first sculpture of a bird. Its title refers to a mythical creature from Romanian legend. Carved from white marble, the work’s streamlined form accentuates the bird’s elongated neck, swollen chest, and tail feathers, imparting a regal elegance commensurate with the subject on which it is based. Maiastra sits perched on a tall tripartite limestone base, the central component of which began as a freestanding sculpture of two figures bearing a stone on their heads, called Double Caryatid. (A caryatid is an architectural support typically carved in the form of a woman.) Maiastra marks the first time the artist incorporated an existing sculpture into a pedestal, a practice he would continue throughout his career.

Aleksandr Rodchenko,Spatial Construction no. 12,"Composed of ovals that nest and intersect, Spatial Construction no. 12 hangs suspended, moving slowly with any current of air. The ovals were measured out on a single flat sheet of plywood, precisely cut, then rotated within each other to make a three-dimensional object. The resulting form suggests a chart of planetary orbits, a cosmic structure. In companion pieces, Rodchenko applied the same principle and method to other basic geometric shapes, such as the square, but those works no longer survive.
Rodchenko’s interest in mathematical systems reflects the scientific bent of the Russian Constructivists, artists who aspired to create a radically new, radically rational art for the society that came into being with the Russian Revolution. Spatial Construction no. 12 is a stage in Rodchenko’s progress away from conventional painting and toward an art taking place in space—ultimately, an art of social involvement. The work has no clear top or bottom, and no base to rest on. It is virtually weightless, with suspension and movement replacing mass. In short, it was designed to be everything traditional sculpture was not—to reimagine art from ground zero. The artist later reflected, “We created a new understanding of beauty, and enlarged the concept of art.”

“The art of the future will not be cozy decorations for domestic apartments,” Rodchenko declared. To create Spatial Construction no. 12, he made a series of concentric cuts to a single flat plane that can then be opened up as a three-dimensional geometric volume. Traces of aluminum paint on the work’s plywood parts suggest that it was a prototype for a metal version. Rodchenko envisioned using multicolored spotlights to illuminate his metallic spatial constructions, triggering a kaleidoscopic play of hues, reflections, and shadows.

In 1920–21, Rodchenko produced a series of ""spatial constructions"" that marked abstraction's move from painted surface to three-dimensional object. Each work was based on the principle of repeating a single form: square, circle, triangle, and here, in this only work surviving from the series, ellipse, which the artist cut in concentric bands from a single piece of painted plywood, working from the outer edge to the center. Each spatial construction could be closed to form a flat plane, but when open it became an airy volume suspended above the ground. Simple as they seem, Rodchenko’s spatial constructions declared an end to the devices of traditional sculpture, being without figuration, mass, or pedestal.

Rodchenko conceived of line as the edge of a plane that is receding in space. In a reverse demonstration of this idea, the nesting ovals that compose this construction were cut from a single sheet of aluminum-painted plywood, then rotated and suspended, transforming what was essentially a plane into a three-dimensional object suggestive of planetary orbits. Rodchenko made this work during a time of civic turmoil and great possibility in Russia, and for him and his Constructivist colleagues line was a component of a new art that would address societal ills, resulting in positive transformation. “In the line a new worldview became clear: to build in essence, and not depict (objectify or non-objectify); build new, expedient, constructive structures in life, and not from life and outside of life,” the artist wrote in 1921.

The nesting ovals that compose this construction were measured out on a single sheet of aluminum-painted plywood, precisely cut, then rotated and suspended to make a three-dimensional object suggestive of planetary orbits. It was made at a time of both civic turmoil and great possibility in Russia, when Rodchenko and his fellow Constructivist artists sought to apply aesthetic ideals to everyday materials. They hoped their approach to art would help create a new language for the Communist state. Reflecting back on this time, Rodchenko said, ""We created a new understanding of beauty, and enlarged the concept of art.""

Ana Mendieta,Nile Born,"In its striking simplicity, Nile Born embodies the communion of a female figure and the land. A simple wooden form is covered in sand, and a large inner channel suggests a vaginal cavity. Organic and sensual, the silhouette represents the body in its most basic form. ""My art is the way I reestablish the bonds that unite me to the universe,"" Mendieta said. ""It is a return to the maternal source."" Born in Cuba, Mendieta was separated from her family at age twelve and exiled to the United States, where she lived in orphanages and foster homes in Iowa throughout her youth.
Works in Mendieta's Silueta series, like Nile Born, are often site-specific, earthbound, and subject to the elements and the fragility of the organic materials from which they are made. Nile Born is one of the last Siluetas Mendieta made before her death in 1985, and the title refers to Cuba's African heritage. The work is an arresting exploration of self, place, belonging, and alienation, concepts that permeate Mendieta's entire oeuvre of installations, earth works, performances, videos, and sculptures.

Robert Gober,Untitled,"Robert Gober’s art is deeply engaged with everyday life—and at the same time profoundly disruptive of it. He emerged in New York in the mid-1980s, presenting deceptively simple sculptures of ordinary objects. Gober created Untitled using materials purchased at a local lumberyard and a neighborhood store. Far from commonplace, though, this bed is surreal: a personal space of dreaming and desire that is strangely generic, recalling a dollhouse copy or a vague childhood memory. Untitled appeared at a moment when the personal was overtly political, when queer communities in New York were fighting for equal rights, and the AIDS crisis was just beginning. Eternally empty, Gober’s “bed” evokes both unfulfilled longing and unfathomable loss.

Named after a mountain in Switzerland, Muttler is part of a 1985 series called Deutschsprachige Gipfel (German-speaking peaks), featuring work Herold made from pairs of underwear stretched on wire armatures and placed atop pedestals of inexpensive particle board. Throughout the 1980s he frequently made artwork from cheaply sourced or found materials, such as roof slats and bricks—examples of what he called ""rough, stupid materials that don’t ask questions."" After defecting to West Germany from socialist East Germany in the 1970s, Herold met fellow artists Martin Kippenberger and Albert Oehlen and developed the satirical, socially critical stance that characterized the network of young artists working in and around Cologne in the 1980s.

Brancusi said of Socrates, “Nothing escapes the great thinker. He knows all, he sees all, he hears all. His eyes are in his ears, his ears are in his eyes.” This work not only reveals Brancusi’s admiration for the Greek philosopher but also alludes to his friendship with composer Erik Satie, whose opera Socrate had been performed in Paris in 1920. In fact, Brancusi addressed Satie, ten years his senior, as Socrates, and Satie called him Plato. Socrates was the first wooden sculpture by Brancusi acquired by MoMA; Alfred H.

The stuffed Pink Panther she clutches with her other hand is cheekily extending his tail toward the waistband of her skirt. Pink Panther is part of Koons’s Banality series, a group of twenty sculptures that draws on both popular culture and mass–market knickknacks. Koons enlarged, combined, and transformed his sources, and had his designs fabricated by European artisans in ceramic and polychromed wood. Sonnabend financed the production of the Banality series over a two–year period, seeing the sculptures for the first time when they were uncrated for exhibition at her New York gallery in 1988.

Umberto Boccioni,Unique Forms of Continuity in Space,"Unique Forms of Continuity in Space integrates trajectories of speed and force into the representation of a striding figure. It does not depict a particular person at a specific moment, but rather synthesizes the process of walking into a single body. For Boccioni, one of the key figures in the Italian Futurist movement, this was an ideal form: a figure in constant motion, immersed in space, engaged with the forces acting upon it.
Boccioni professed no love for classical or Renaissance sculpture. In Futurist Painting Sculpture, a manifesto-style book published in 1914, he wrote that “anyone today who considers Italy to be the country of art is a necrophiliac who thinks of a cemetery as a delightful little alcove.” He declared that art should “have a strict historical relation with the moment in which it appears”; the sculpture of the early twentieth century, he felt, would evoke the speed and dynamism of Italy’s recent industrialization. Boccioni and the other Futurists even embraced the coming world war as a natural development, one that would destroy the remnants of the past and bring humans and machines closer together.

“Let us fling open the figure and let it incorporate within itself whatever may surround it,” Boccioni exclaimed. Breaking with sculptural tradition, he opened up the silhouette of this marching figure, who forges ahead as if carved by speed. While the triumphant stance and armless torso evoke statues from earlier art history, the polished metal alludes to sleek new technologies. Boccioni was a central figure in the Futurist movement, whose members vehemently renounced the past in favor of creating forms that emulated the dynamism and ingenuity of the machine age.

While born of Futurist aspirations, it also remains evocative of an ancient statue: the wind-swept, striding Victory of Samothrace in the Musée du Louvre in Paris.

Marisol (Marisol Escobar),The Family,"Made primarily of blocks of wood, Marisol’s sculptures combine painting and figurative drawing with found objects—such as the sneakers and door in The Family. “In the beginning,” the artist explained, “I drew on a piece of wood because I was going to carve it, and then I noticed that I didn’t have to carve it, because it looked as if it was carved already.” This work was based on a photograph of a family whose worn clothes and shoes suggest hardscrabble circumstances; with characteristic warmth and wit, Marisol has translated their dignity and charisma into three dimensions.

Claes Oldenburg,"Two Cheeseburgers, with Everything (Dual Hamburgers)","In December 1961, Oldenburg rented a small storefront on East Second Street in New York and filled it with handmade, brightly painted objects that recalled the products—shirts, watches, sausages, slices of pie—available for purchase in stores throughout the neighborhood. This marked the beginning of a multiyear project collectively referred to as The Store. The second iteration took place at the Green Gallery on Fifty-Seventh Street, a commercial enterprise in the center of midtown, a few blocks from MoMA. Taking advantage of the larger square footage available to him, the artist exhibited three oversize soft sculptures sewn by his wife, Patty Mucha, and painted by Oldenburg himself: an ice-cream cone, a piece of cake, and a hamburger. Alongside these colossi, he included smaller plaster works, including Two Cheeseburgers, with Everything (Dual Hamburgers), made just slightly larger than their real-life counterparts. The dissonance created by extreme shifts in scale would occupy the artist for the remainder of his career.
Two Cheeseburgers is a testament to Oldenburg’s ingenuity as a sculptor and his penchant for infusing work with witty and occasionally dark humor. Placed side by side and piled high with toppings, each burger, ostensibly an object to be eaten, also resembles a mouth ready to take a bite. When MoMA’s founding director, Alfred H. Barr, Jr., visited The Store, he purportedly purchased Two Cheeseburgers on the spot—an acquisition for the Museum’s collection.

Salvador Dalí,Retrospective Bust of a Woman,"Like other Surrealists, Dalí constructed sculpture from disparate found objects. The genesis of this work was his discovery of an inkwell featuring the figures from Jean-Francois Millet's painting The Angelus (1857–59). He embedded the inkwell in a loaf of bread and placed them both on an accessorized bust. The necklace is a strip of repeating images from a zoetrope, a precinematic toy that provides the illusion of movement as it rotates.

In 1931 Dalí described Surrealist sculpture as ""absolutely useless and created wholly for the purpose of materializing in a fetishistic way, with maximum tangible reality, ideas and fantasies of a delirious character."" Made just a few years after this provocative statement, Retrospective Bust of a Woman not only presents a woman as an object, but explicitly as one to be consumed. A long phallic baguette crowns her head, cobs of corns dangle around her neck, and ants swarm along her forehead as if gathering crumbs. When this work was exhibited in 1933, Pablo Picasso's dog is reputed to have eaten the original loaf of bread.

Henri Matisse,Jeannette (II),"In the process of creating five busts of Jeanne Vaderin between 1910 and 1916, Matisse radically reconfigured traditional representation of the human face. Jeannette I and II were created directly from the model, which is evident in their characteristic, hawklike profiles. These two works then served as templates for Jeannette III, IV, and V. As he progressed with the series, Matisse dramatically abstracted his subject, organizing the head into increasingly simplified chunks. In 1908 he explained that his goal in portraiture was not to achieve visual precision but rather to reveal the ""essential qualities"" of his sitters—qualities, he felt, that physical imitation could not capture.

Claes Oldenburg,Red Tights with Fragment 9,"According to Oldenburg, this relief recalls his “vision of a pair of red teenage tights seen in the wind at the corner of Avenue A and 14th Street.” The work refers to this display of merchandise, but its jagged edges and the single number 9 also lend it the appearance of a torn advertisement. Oldenburg often tore images of commercial goods from magazines and newspapers as source material for his sculptures, which he described in 1961 as “rips out of reality,” fusing the printed advertisement with three-dimensional reality. Looking back, in 1970 the artist explained, “Vision at that time, for me, was assumed flatter, and what was seen, taken as a plane surface, like a film, mirror, or newspaper. Thus an advertisement or part of one, ripped from a newspaper, was taken to correspond to a glance at the plane of vision.”

Painting or sculpture? Organic or industrial? Invitation or threat? This untitled work is a rectangle of canvas, like a painting, but one that pushes its faceted, equivocally machinelike mouth out from the wall. Many have seen in Bontecou’s works of this kind, with their built-up rims and hollow voids, the nacelles or casings of jet engines. The artist, too, has acknowledged their inﬂuence: “Airplanes at one time, jets mainly,” she said, in answer to an interviewer’s question about the inspiration for her work. Interest in the streamlined products of modernity may link Bontecou to Pop art, a movement that was developing in the early 1960s, but her work’s dark and restricted palette gives it a sobriety distant from much of Pop, and she describes the world more obliquely. Also, instead of replicating an engine’s metallic surfaces, she has stitched panels of canvas over a steel skeleton. If this is a machine, it is a soft one—which, again, leads many to think of the body and its charged interiors and openings.
Mystery is one quality Bontecou is interested in, as well as “fear, hope, ugliness, beauty.” As for those inky cavities, a consistent theme, she has remarked, “I like space that never stops. Black is like that. Holes and boxes mean secrets and shelter.”

Taking canvas from conveyor belts discarded by a laundry below her East Village apartment, Bontecou stretched pieces of the fabric across a steel armature and fastened them to the metal with wire. Expanding out from the wall in an unusual construction that contains a prominent void at the center, Untitled straddles the boundaries between painting and sculpture, mechanical and organic, inviting and threatening. Bontecou created this sculpture in a year marked by intense anxiety: the Bay of Pigs invasion in Cuba failed, the United States committed its first troops to Vietnam, and the construction of the Berlin Wall began. In a rare statement, she wrote, ""My concern is to build things that express our relation to this country--to other countries--to this world--to other worlds to glimpse some of the fear, hope, ugliness, beauty and mystery that exists in us all and which hangs over all the young people today.""

When Bontecou first exhibited her steel-and-canvas sculptures, many praised their aggressive, ominous qualities. Fellow artist Joseph Cornell described their gaping black cavities as summoning ""the terror of the yawning mouths of cannons, of violent craters, of windows opened to receive your flight without return, and the jaws of the great beasts.""
The year Bontecou made this work was marked by intense anxiety: the Bay of Pigs invasion in Cuba failed, the U.S. committed its first troops to Vietnam, and the construction of the Berlin Wall began. Although Bontecou rarely comments on her art, in a statement that accompanied a 1963 MoMA exhibition featuring this work, she wrote, ""My concern is to build things that express our relation to this country—to other countries—to this world—to other worlds—to glimpse some of the fear, hope, ugliness, beauty and mystery that exists in us all and which hangs over all the young people today.""

Joseph Cornell,Taglioni's Jewel Casket,"The first of dozens of works that Cornell made in honor of famous ballerinas, this box pays homage to Marie Taglioni, an acclaimed nineteenth-century dancer of Italian origin, who, according to the legend inscribed in the box’s lid, kept an imitation ice cube in her jewelry box to commemorate the time she danced in the snow at the behest of a Russian highwayman. The box is infused with erotic undertones—both in the tactile nature of the glass cubes, velvet, and rhinestone necklace (purchased at a Woolworth’s dime store in New York) and in the incident itself, in which Taglioni reportedly performed on an animal skin placed across a snowy road. Adding to the intimacy of this delicate construction, the glass cubes were designed to be removed, revealing a hidden recess below that contains two beaded necklaces and rhinestone chips placed on a mirrored surface and seen through blue-tinted glass.
Although he spent his entire career based in Queens, New York, Cornell drew inspiration from the European art he saw at the city’s Julien Levy Gallery—the first in the United States to exhibit Surrealist work—and his art often inspired the European Surrealists in turn. In a press release for a 1939 show by Cornell at the gallery, Salvador Dalí heralded the artist’s work as “the only truly Surrealist work to be found in America.”

Kiki Smith,Untitled,"In Smith’s long-standing engagement with the body, she has often addressed issues of sexuality, feminism, and mortality. This work is composed of glass water-cooler bottles coated with silver and etched with the names of twelve bodily fluids: tears, urine, milk, blood, saliva, vomit, sperm, etc. Drawn from the theology of Smith’s Catholic faith, the fluids constitute the sacramental body. The German Gothic lettering on the bottles is a reference to a medieval book of hours, a Christian prayer book. According to the artist, “I was very influenced by the lives of the saints when I was a kid—you have a
body with attributes and artifacts evoked by a sort of magic.”

        Additional text






In this work, twelve water-cooler bottles, silvered to a mirror surface, are each engraved with the name of a different bodily fluid: blood, tears, urine, milk, and more. The piece was inspired, Smith has said, by the medieval book of hours, the volumes of Christian observance that provided ""some kind of meditation, something you could think about or believe in,"" for every hour of the day. Choosing ""fluids everyone knows about that come out of the body,"" Smith found physical substitutes for the intangibles of religious belief. She also created a provocative friction between the scale and uniform shape of the bottles and the intimate and internal processes evoked by the words they bear.
For Smith, the human body, even more than human consciousness, is ""our primary vehicle for experiencing our lives."" A more consistent presence in Smith's art than any format or medium (her materials range from concrete to glass, and she has also produced many prints), the body is a widespread concern in the art of the 1980s and 1990s. This focus is partly aesthetic, reflecting a need to break from immediate precedents—the dematerialized linguistic propositions of Conceptual art, or the hard, machine-made, geometric surfaces of Minimalism. But the period also saw intense public debate on issues of sexuality and health, and on their convergence in the AIDS crisis.

Marcel Duchamp,Bicycle Wheel,"Though Bicycle Wheel predates Duchamp’s use of the word “readymade”—a term he coined after moving from Paris to New York in 1915—it is the earliest example of this class of groundbreaking artworks. Like most of Duchamp’s existing readymades, MoMA’s Bicycle Wheel is a later version of an earlier creation, made for a 1951 exhibition at the Sidney Janis Gallery in New York. As was his penchant at that point in his career, Duchamp found others to do much of the work for him: Sidney Janis, the gallery’s owner, selected the bicycle wheel while in Paris and found the stool in Brooklyn, and Duchamp put the two together. What mattered to Duchamp was the transmission of a readymade’s concept, not its exact physical appearance.
Bicycle Wheel distinguishes itself from all of the artist’s subsequent readymades by virtue of its central object’s implicit movement, a quality Duchamp appreciated for its calming effects. “To see that wheel turning,” he once remarked, “was very soothing, very comforting, a sort of opening of avenues on other things than material life of every day. I liked the idea of having a bicycle wheel in my studio. I enjoyed looking at it, just as I enjoyed looking at the flames dancing in a fireplace. It was like having a fireplace in my studio.”

        Additional text






Marcel Duchamp was a pioneer of Dada, a movement that questioned long-held assumptions about what art should be and how it should be made. In the years immediately preceding World War I, he found success as a painter in Paris. But he soon gave up painting almost entirely, explaining, “I was interested in ideas—not merely in visual products.” In this spirit, he began selecting mass-produced, commercially available, and often utilitarian items, designating them as art, and giving them titles. These “Readymades,” as he called them, disrupted centuries of thinking about the artist’s role as a skilled creator of original, handmade objects. Instead, he argued that “an ordinary object [could be] elevated to the dignity of a work of art by the mere choice of an artist.” Duchamp claimed he selected objects regardless of “good or bad taste,” defying the notion that art must be pleasing to the eye.

Pablo Picasso,She-Goat,"Picasso's studio in the town of Vallauris, where he worked beginning in 1948, was next to a yard into which potters threw debris—pieces of metal and shards of ceramics. After deciding to sculpt a goat, Picasso searched the yard for discarded materials that could suggest parts of the animal's body. He crafted a skeleton with these objects, and filled out the sculpture with plaster. A wicker basket forms the goat's rib cage; two ceramic jugs were modified to serve as its udders. Flat palm fronds shape the slope of the goat's spine and the length of its snout, and metal scraps are used as structural units throughout.

This sculpture is the earliest extant Endless Column. In preceding years Brancusi had used a single or double pyramid as a base for his sculpture, but he eventually came to see this abstract construction as a fully realized work in its own right. Carved from oak, this succession of pyramids forms a rhythmic and undulating geometry that suggests the possibility of infinite expansion. Like other favorite motifs, this was one that Brancusi would return to over the course of his career. In the mid-1920s, he carved an Endless Column for his friend the photographer Edward Steichen that rose more than twenty-three feet. And in 1937 Brancusi erected a steel Endless Column in Tîrgu-Jiu, Romania, that soared more than ninety-eight feet into the air. That Endless Column, his last, was part of a larger sculptural ensemble that included The Gate of the Kiss and Table of Silence, which formed the artist’s only foray into public sculpture.

Brancusi made several versions of his Endless Column, this one being the first he fully developed. It consists of a single symmetrical element, a pair of truncated pyramids stuck together at their base, then repeated to produce a continuous rhythmic line. In replicating the same abstract shape, Brancusi emphasized its potential for vertical expansion—it was, he later said, a “column for infinity.” In Brancusi’s work generally the pedestal that traditionally supported sculpture, usually a secondary element, took on a new prominence, often equal to that of the artwork itself: he first used the geometric motif seen here in bases for his sculptures, but gradually realized its value as an independent form. He later repeated the Endless Column on larger scales and in different materials, making it serve as an architectural element and a monument. This version is carved directly in oak, with gouges and cuts in the wood readily apparent, so that it straightforwardly declares its own materials and process of making. Its simplicity, directness, and modularity helped to define the foundational principles of modern abstract sculpture.

Lynda Benglis,Modern Art,"In late 1969, Benglis made a group of works by pouring colored liquid latex on the floor and letting it dry into irregular, rubbery chunks. Soon after, she began subjecting liquid metals to the same methods, pouring them into freestanding sculptures. Works such as _Modern Art_—which was executed in bronze, aluminum, lead and tin—share industrial materials with their Minimalist antecedents, yet their forms are also insistently biomorphic, even scatological. Modern Art consists of four parts, each in a different metal, but the work was divided for some twenty-five years: The bronze and aluminum parts were given to the Museum in 1977. The artist reunited the four elements of the work by donating the tin parts in 2012.

        Additional text






Less an image of a fish than an embodiment of the idea of one, Fish conjures the animal's liquid course by simplifying details like fin and scale, tail and head, into smooth streamline. (""Simplicity,"" Brancusi believed, ""is not an end in art, but we usually arrive at simplicity as we approach the true sense of things."") The material too contributes: a blue-gray marble veined with flecks of flowing white, its surface intimates both movement through water and moving water itself.
Brancusi was fascinated by animals, and believed in the primacy of animal consciousness. In reducing animals to elemental shapes, he felt he was approaching the essence of nature. Also, like a number of European artists of his period, he was excited by art from outside the classical tradition so influential in Western aesthetics. The art of Africa, Native America, and the Pacific, and also the art of prehistory (including Cycladic sculpture, a particular influence on Brancusi), took imaginative liberties with human and animal bodies, alternately exaggerating, attenuating, and eliminating their features. These examples liberated Brancusi and others in their treatment of form. By the time he made Fish, in fact, Brancusi seems almost to have left form behind altogether, for something more incorporeal: what he described as the fish's ""speed, its floating, flashing body seen through the water . . . the flash of its spirit.""

Aristide Maillol,The River,"The daring instability and torsion of The River are rare in Maillol's sculpture. Instead of trying to emulate the dynamism of twentieth-century life, as did so many artists of his time, Maillol usually sought an art of serenity and stillness, of classical nobility and simplicity. As late as 1937, in fact, he remarked, ""For my taste, there should be as little movement as possible in sculpture."" Yet within a year or so afterward he had conceived The River, a work in which the movement is almost reckless.
Commissioned to create a monument to a notable pacifist, the French writer Henri Barbusse, Maillol conceived the sculpture as a work on the theme of war: a woman stabbed in the back, and falling. When the commission fell through, he transformed the idea into The River. In a departure from the usual conventions of monumental sculpture, the figure lies low to the ground and rests apparently precariously on the pedestal, even hanging below its edge. Twisting and turning, her raised arms suggesting the pressure of some powerful current, this woman is the personification of moving water.

Hans Bellmer,The Machine-Gunneress in a State of Grace,"Bellmer began creating disturbing dolls in 1933, the year Adolf Hitler assumed power in Germany. Many have interpreted them as acts of political defiance against the Aryan ideals and social norms promoted by the Nazis, whom he openly opposed, and expressions of the personal outrage he felt towards his father, who had joined the Nazi party. Bellmer himself stated, ""If the origin of my work is scandalous, it is because for me, the world is a scandal."" Made in Berlin one year before the artist left for Paris, where he lived for the better part of the rest of his life, this figure is violently fragmented, its body parts splayed and truncated and its scale distorted. Connected mechanically by ball joints, its appendages offer endless perverse recombinations.

David Smith,Cubi X,"In Cubi X gleaming stainless steel rectangles and squares of various dimensions are assembled to evoke the human figure. Despite its monumental scale, the organization of the asymmetrical forms onto a variety of spatial planes—vertical, tilted, or horizontal—leads the eye upward, against gravity. Between 1961 and 1965, Smith made a series of twenty–eight sculptures that he termed ""Cubi."" The name, which Smith invented, links them to Cubism. The geometric shapes, their two–dimensional orientation, and the shimmering effects of the polished and scratched stainless steel surfaces recall the paintings of Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque from the early twentieth century.

Smith often worked in series. Cubi, his last and best known, consists of twenty-eight stainless steel sculptures made between 1961 and 1965. Cubi X is an abstract construction of geometric forms that evokes, through its vertical orientation, the human figure. It can be shown indoors or out, and its burnished surface catches and reflects the surrounding light. “This is the only time, in these stainless steel pieces, that I have been able to utilize the light and I depend upon the reflective power of light,” Smith said of the work. “It does have a semi-mirror reflection and I like it in that sense because no other material in sculpture can do that.”

Julio González,"Head of the Montserrat, II","This head of a peasant woman with her face frozen in terror was cast in bronze from a plaster left in González's studio at the time of his death in 1942. The artist made several paintings and sculptures of this subject beginning in 1936, in response to the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, which claimed the lives of thousands of civilians before its conclusion in 1939. Montserrat is a mountain range in the Catalonia region of Spain, where González was born; it is also a popular first name for women of the region. This representational work marked a radical departure from the abstract, Cubist-inspired sculptures for which González was best known at the time. In 1937, a full figure sculpture of the same subject stood at the entrance to the Spanish Pavilion at the International Exhibition of Art and Technology in Modern Art in Paris—a response to Fascist violence in Spain.

Eva Hesse,Repetition Nineteen III,"Hesse was drawn to unconventional materials like fiberglass, an industrial material that discolors and deteriorates over time. In a 1970 interview, she discussed the development of her choices: “I varied the materials even further . . . and then they just grew. They came from the floor, the ceiling, the walls, then it just became whatever it became.” Repetition Nineteen III was one of the first sculptures in which Hesse used fiberglass, a material that quickly became her favorite to work with. Like many artists of her generation, she explored repetition but, unlike her peers, she did not adhere to uniformity. None of these bucket-like forms are exactly alike, nor do they have a set order.

Repetition Nineteen III comprises nineteen bucket-like forms, all the same shape but none exactly alike. The Minimalist artists, who emerged a little before Hesse did, had explored serial repetitions of identical units. Hesse loosened that compositional strategy: Repetition Nineteen III is simultaneously repetitive and irregular. She also tended to work on a humbler scale than the Minimalists often had, and her forms and materials are less technocratic; she herself called the soft, molded forms in Repetition Nineteen III “anthropomorphic” and recognized sexual connotations in these “empty containers.”
Made of translucent industrial fiberglass, one of Hesse’s favorite materials, Repetition Nineteen III is the third version she planned. (The ﬁrst was in papier-mâché; the second, which she imagined initially in metal, then in latex, was never completed.) Besides beautifully modulating the light, the ﬁberglass seems both soft and hard, contributing to the richly paradoxical character of these subtle objects: nonconformist individuals that somehow make a group. The arrangement, whatever it is, seems both random and coherent, uniﬁed by a similarity preserved through difference. Hesse expressed a sense of openness around the installation of the work. “I don’t ask that the piece be moved or changed,” she reflected, “only that it could be moved and changed. There is not one preferred format.”

Louise Bourgeois,The Quartered One,"The Quartered One is from a series of sculptures that Bourgeois characterized as ""lairs."" The lair had contradictory implications for the artist, who said, “""[It] is for seclusion and rest. But the security of the lair can also be a trap."" Hanging like a pendulum, with hollowed-out appendages that can be peered into and a spine-like track on its back, the sculpture suggests both a large nest and some kind of animal or carcass. By the time she made this sculpture, Bourgeois had been working for two decades, but her art had received scant critical attention. Beginning in the mid-1960s, however, a younger generation of artists and critics embraced her work for the way it mined psychological and subjective states.

Jean (Hans) Arp,Enak's Tears (Terrestrial Forms),"In polychrome wood reliefs such as this, Arp was the first to utilize ""biomorphic"" forms suggesting kidney and amoeba-like shapes to establish a new, counter-Cubist form-language. These organic shapes soon came to represent the most credible alternative to Cubist and Constructivist geometry and inspired artists of the next three decades, from Miró to Gorky.

Though many Dadaist and Surrealist artists were practicing poets, Arp is one of the very few whose poetry stands in both quality and quantity as an important contribution in its own right. The involvement of the painters of these movements with poetry produced a variety of rapports between the two arts, some of which endowed their peinture-poésie with new and unexpected dimensions, but others of which tended to vitiate their painting through a dilution of aesthetic modes. Arp's collages, reliefs, and sculpture share with his poetry an iconography...a gentle whimsy, and a feeling of naturalness, but nowhere is their plasticity compromised.
For three years prior to the emergence of his personal style in the winter of 1915/1916, Arp had worked within the discipline of Cubism. Then in collages, and in machine-sawn reliefs such as the Portrait of Tzara of 1916 and Enak's Tears of 1917, the prevailing rectilinear structures of the Cubist work dissolved under the pressure of a new curvilinear, ""organic"" morphology.
This biomorphism had its roots in Art Nouveau, although there it was primarily linear in style and botanical in its associations. Arp established it in terms of closed flat forms that were endowed with anthropomorphic allusions as well....
In the face of Analytic Cubism's searching but ultimately assured equilibrium and stasis, Arp's reliefs unwind in an improvisational, meandering manner that implies growth and change. Here is no longer the sober, classical scaffolding of the external world of architecture. The forms of the Portrait of Tzara and Enak's Tears, while describing nothing specifically, multiply associations to physiological and botanical processes, to sexuality, and through their very ambiguity, to humor.
Although biomorphism initiated a new vocabulary of forms, it did not in itself constitute a style in the sense that Impressionism or Cubism did; nor did it generate any new comprehensive principle of design or distribution of the total surface, or of the illusion of space, in pictures. Rather it provided constituent shapes for paintings in a variety of styles. When more than one or two such shapes are used by the ""abstract"" Surrealists we almost always find them disposed in relation to one another and to the frame in a Cubist manner. Thus, while we may speak of the form-language or morphology of Arp, [André] Masson, and [Joan] Miró as anti-Cubist, this does not apply to the over-all structure of their compositions, since on that level these painters cling to organizational principles assimilated from the Cubism that all of them had practiced earlier.

The translucent resin captures the qualities of the surrounding sky; the sculpture’s color and brightness change throughout the day, and it becomes a near-invisible whisper at night. Whiteread has called this work “a jewel on the skyline of Manhattan.” Soaring and ephemeral, it inspires city dwellers and visitors alike to look again at the solid, weighty water towers they usually see without noticing.

David Smith,Australia,"When Smith completed Australia, it was his largest sculpture to that date. By welding together thin rods and plates of steel, he created a work simultaneously delicate and strong, a fusion of tension, balance, and form that he described as a “drawing in space.” Sculpture had traditionally been defined by volume and mass; Australia, by contrast, is built of lines.

Perched on a slender column, which in turn rests on a cinder block, Australia’s steel parts resemble an energetic creature whose springy bounce has been arrested in midair. At the time of its completion, the work was Smith’s largest sculpture to date, and it was also the first of his large-scale works that did not rely on a frame-like contour to define its physical relationship to its environment. Although we know that Smith sketched the sculpture’s structure in advance, its open and linear qualities feel spontaneous and dynamic, characteristics that signaled a departure from contained sculptural form and aligned Smith with the contemporaneous generation of abstract painters.
Smith had never visited the continent of Australia and made the sculpture with no conscious thought of the place or its natural features in mind. In a letter to an Australian art critic in 1952, he explained that his choice of title was intuitively inspired by the structure of the work: “After completion,” he wrote, “I realized that elements of purely imagined kangaroo anatomy, leaves that I imagined koalas would eat, memories of bushman art, and unidentified flora and fauna of Australia assembled in a more or less dream form, all contributed to the finished work which to my mind had no possible title except Australia.”

		Publication excerpt from MoMA Highlights: 375 Works from The Museum of Modern Art, New York (New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 2019)
	




""I do not recognize the limits where painting ends and sculpture begins."" So said Smith, who, in making Australia, used thin rods and plates of steel—simultaneously delicate and strong—to paint in space. Like a painting, Australia must be seen frontally if its form is to be grasped. It has been identified as an abstraction of a kangaroo, and its lines have that animal's leaping vitality. Though he began his career as a painter, Smith was inspired to make welded metal sculptures in 1930 when he saw those made by Pablo Picasso and Julio González.

Pablo Picasso,Woman's Head (Fernande),"Picasso sculpted Woman's Head (Fernande) out of clay in Paris in the fall of 1909. It was made directly after the artist spent the summer in Horta de Ebro, Spain, where he painted numerous portraits of his companion, Fernande Olivier. Woman's Head (Fernande) shows Picasso working through ideas that would become central to Cubism. The sculpture maintains the basic shape of a head, but its projected and recessed planes break down solid mass into shifting volumes that are suggestive of different points of view.
Picasso's dealer, Ambroise Vollard, bought the original clay version from Picasso in 1910, and with the artist's permission he arranged for it to be cast in plaster and then in bronze.

Diego Rivera,Cubist Landscape,"Cubist Landscape was inspired by a trip Rivera made in 1911 to Spain, where he encountered the olive trees of Catalonia. The serrated blue ridge in the painting evokes Montserrat, a mountain in the region. The work exemplifies the idiosyncratic approach to Cubism that Rivera developed in the 1910s, when he lived in Paris. He saw these early works, which combine a sun-drenched palette with kaleidoscopic planes and abstract patterning, as a way of beginning to forge a specifically Mexican modernism. “My Cubist paintings,” he said, “are my most Mexican.”

Ellsworth Kelly,Relief with Blue,"In 1949 Kelly saw a Parisian repertory production of Hamlet that relied only on black and gray curtains of varying depths and widths for changes of scene and colored lights to change the mood. Kelly's sketch of one particular curtain design inspired this wood construction. The juxtaposition of the rectangle with the curvilinear panels is a formal theme that continued to preoccupy him, as did the bright light–blue color first used in this work. The curved wood components anticipate the shaped canvases of his New York work.

Hermann Finsterlin,"Study for a House of Sociability, project,","Finsterlin, a painter, toy designer, and architectural theorist, is associated with German Expressionist architecture of the 1920s. Molded or cast models like this one played an important part in Finsterlin’s design process. “He proposed an architecture that would essentially be hollow sculpture, free of functional considerations,” wrote MoMA curator Arthur Drexler when the exuberantly colorful model was acquired in 1969. Finsterlin had a habit of retroactively dating his postwar pieces to the 1920s; the missing completion date here reflects this ambiguity.

The Ministry’s workers could adjust the angle of these sun- blocking devices throughout the course of the day, preventing the interior from overheating and thus increasing the thermal comfort of their working space without having to rely on energy-consuming air conditioning.

William H. Johnson,Blind Singer,"William H. Johnson was among the foremost painters of African-American life during the Harlem Renaissance. Born in South Carolina and educated in fine arts in New York and Provincetown, Johnson spent most of his time from the mid-1920s to the late 1930s in Europe, where he was influenced by Post-Impressionism and Expressionism. After achieving critical acclaim abroad, he returned to New York permanently in 1938 under the threat of war and with a desire to reconnect to his roots. The move produced a dramatic change in his work. Assigned by the government's Works Progress Administration to teach at the Harlem Community Art Center, Johnson became immersed in the sights, sounds, and people of New York's African-American community, which he captured in compositions of flat shapes, patterned designs, and brilliant colors that were distinctly modernist in their simplicity and directness.
During his lifetime, Johnson created more than seventy-five prints. While in Europe he produced woodcuts and linoleum cuts, usually with hand coloring, inspired by the raw power of German Expressionism. After returning to New York, he took up screenprint and pochoir, techniques that suited his new embrace of simplified forms and bold colors. He printed these works on assorted found papers and often completed his images by hand with tempera, making each print slightly different from the next. He frequently experimented with subjects by printing compositional variants and also rendering them in drawing and painting, each format enriching the other, but with the printed versions the most simplified of all.
Notable among Johnson's New York prints are those that capture the essence of Harlem's fashion, music, and dance. This print, entitled Blind Singer, shows a pair of musicians in an open-air performance that was common on the city's bustling streets. The composition's flatness, pure color, and orchestrated angularity endow this still image with a sense of rhythmic motion and dynamic energy.

André Derain,Bridge over the Riou,"Although Bridge over the Riou describes a place in the south of France, its complexly patterned composition suggests a gradual reworking and reshaping rather than a quick and fluid response to what Derain saw there. From the foreground bank, over the riverbed, to the higher ground beyond, the space is compressed and flattened, but the scene can still be identified—the bridge at the lower right, a cabin down in the ravine, the beehive form of a covered well. Houses appear beyond the river, behind the trees.
In 1905 Derain and his peers in the Fauvist group had created a succés de scandale through their radical use of color, but they still accepted from Impressionism the idea that a painting should follow nature, and should try to capture the passing moment of contemporary life. By 1906, however, Derain wanted to create images that would ""belong to all time"" as well as to his own period, and the separate strokes of color seen in his paintings of 1905 are here subsumed into larger colored shapes, some of them outlined in exotic blues or lavenders, or an indian red or pink, say, for a tree trunk. This emotionally high-keyed color relates to the intensity of the light in the south of France, yet belongs less to nature than to art.

Sophie Taeuber-Arp,Head,"Taeuber-Arp, a pioneering abstract artist, was trained in the applied and fine arts and ascribed equal importance to both. In 1920, at the time Head was made, she was best known for her arts-and-crafts creations, including textile designs, turned-wood containers, beaded necklaces, notebook covers, and bags. Head combines mechanically produced turned-wood pieces and beaded ornaments typically associated with domestic handicrafts to create a sculpture that challenges the boundaries separating craft from fine art.
The work strongly resembles Study for a Marionette (Portrait of H.A.) (1918), an abstract depiction of the artist Jean (Hans) Arp, whom Taeuber-Arp would marry in 1922. Both works have bobbin-shaped bases, trapezoidal noses, oval heads, and cylindrical necks, and they have similar dimensions. This suggests that Head is a counterpart to the earlier work, and a stylized self-portrait. Taeuber-Arp made this sculpture in Zurich, where she had become associated with Dada, a cultural movement that embraced absurdity and abstraction as avenues to a radical rethinking of contemporary social, political, and aesthetic conventions.

Cindy Sherman,Untitled Film Still #61,"Cindy Sherman’s Untitled Film Stills is a suite of seventy black-and-white photographs in which the artist posed in the guises of various generic female film characters, among them, ingénue, working girl, vamp, and lonely housewife. Staged to resemble scenes from 1950s and ’60s Hollywood, film noir, B movies, and European art-house films, the printed images mimic in format, scale, and quality the often-staged “stills” used to promote films. By photographing herself in such roles, Sherman inserts herself into a dialogue about stereotypical portrayals of women. Whether she was the one to release the camera’s shutter or not, she is considered the author of the photographs. However, the works in Untitled Film Stills are not considered self-portraits.

Lygia Clark,Sundial,"Sundial is what Clark called a bicho, or critter—a type of sculpture whose hinged metal sheets can be folded into multiple configurations or flattened to a single plane. Though strictly geometric and carefully structured around several axes, the work becomes elusive and unpredictable once activated. Clark thought that to interact with Sundial was to engage in a process of mutual discovery and transformation through which identity—the participant’s and the work’s—can be radically redefined.

        Additional text






Sundial belongs to Clark's Animals series, begun in 1960—a group of metal sculptures whose forms can be endlessly modified. The works in this series are flat, curving structures that fold in different ways along a spine–like axis. Capable of many variations in form, they can also be reduced to a flat plane. Sundial was conceived to invite the spectator to modify its foldable geometric shapes.

Lygia Clark,Poetic Shelter,"In 1960 Clark began to produce movable metal sculptures that could be modified by the spectator from three–dimensional planes to flat reliefs. She titled this series Bichos (Critters), making reference to animals and organic structures, as in her sculpture Sundial. Poetic Shelter is a key piece, leading to the conclusion of the series by privileging space over flatness and presenting construction as a form of shelter. In this work, as in her drawings, Clark liberates plane and line from their inanimate condition and recovers their vitality through movement and transformation in space.

Hélio Oiticica,Neoconcrete Relief,"Neoconcrete Relief is simultaneously a painting and an object that questions the identity and function of both: a three–dimensional plane, whose presence in the exhibition space implies a physical encounter between the viewer and the work. The artist wrote, ""The wall here serves not as a background but as an extraneous, unlimited space, though necessary to the vision of the work."" It belongs to a group of paintings that Oiticica conceived as manifestos for a break with the traditional rectangular picture plane. Limited to two colors on wood, it is a nonrepresentational work in which the plane functions actively, rather than as a support for figures or colors.

Joaquín Torres-García,Construction in White and Black,"Torres-García rejected the opposition of figuration and abstraction, preferring to think of his painting as “constructive” and emphasizing facture rather than the final image. In this example, the contrast between black and white is the sole means used to construct a syncopated grid which seems to protrude outward as much as it recedes into the picture plane. The effect of volume and irregular geometry evokes ancient architectonic structures, like those of the Incan stonework in which Torres-García was particularly interested.
In the late 1930s, Torres-García developed a personal philosophy of art that he called Constructive Universalism. Through it he advanced his views of art as a means to organize the natural world and human experience according to universal laws of unity. His ideas were influenced greatly by the geometric abstraction practiced by the artists in the group Cercle et Carré (Circle and Square), which he helped found in Paris in 1930. When Torres-García returned to his native Uruguay in 1934, he worked to synthesize European modernism and indigenous traditions. The inscription “AAC” in the lower-right corner of this painting refers to the Asociación de Arte Constructivo, a group the artist established to disseminate modern art in South America and to adapt it to local traditions.

        Additional text






Construction in White and Black is characteristic of Torres-García’s use of the golden section to create harmonious grids within his paintings. It also shows his interest in the structure of indigenous art and architecture of the Americas. The shaded, rhythmic rectangular sections of this simple grid evoke Inca masonry. Torres-García strove to create a visual language that he termed “universal constructivism.” It combined visual traditions from across history and geography, in order to create a symbolic language which could be understood by all people.

Kurt Schwitters,Plate 6 from Merz 3,"According to Schwitters, his collage-based art form called _Merz “_denotes essentially the combination of all conceivable materials for artistic purposes.” Merz fused found materials—from paper scraps to fragments of overheard conversations—into art forms ranging from poetry to assemblage. Between 1923 and 1932, Schwitters sporadically published twenty–two issues of Merz; the third issue comprises a portfolio of six unbound lithographs. The grids of squares and rectangles that appear in various scales, shades, and patterns throughout these prints are layered with colorful fragments from advertisements and children’s books—additions that reflect the fragmented social, political, and economic realities of postwar Germany. The prints are detailed with large capital letters, human and doll-like figures, and a duplicated kitten. This layering of commercial ephemera, hand-drawn imagery, and collage demonstrates how Schwitters applied chance and improvisation to his printmaking process and exposes the additive nature of printmaking.

Robert Rauschenberg,Rebus,"Rauschenberg described Rebus as “a record of the immediate environment and time.” A collection of words and images, it constitutes a kind of unsolvable puzzle. The materials, found in the neighborhood around his studio, include comic strips, fabric remnants, a museum poster, and a drawing by his friend the artist Cy Twombly. The work functions as both portrait and landscape, recording the artist’s creative impulses at the moment of its making, while also using materials drawn from mass media.

        Additional text






Rebus belongs to a body of work in which Rauschenberg integrated three-dimensional objects with two-dimensional paintings. His friend Jasper Johns coined the term Combine for such works, describing them as “painting playing the game of sculpture.” Made from layers of everyday materials found in the neighborhood of his Lower Manhattan studio (comic strips, political posters, fabric, and drawings), this work maintains a flatter, sparser surface than most of the artist’s Combines.

Philip Guston,Gladiators,"Guston created Gladiators in a style that merged Renaissance figure painting with what he called “cubist conceptions of space.” While working on Gladiators, Guston was also painting murals in New York as a part of a Works Progress Administration program. The theme of fighting children seen here is adapted from Work and Play, a mural the artist completed in the lobby of the Queensbridge housing project in Long Island City, Queens, in 1940. Soon thereafter, Guston transitioned away from murals to the easel painting and abstract works for which he would later gain prominence.

Her breakthrough moment arrived via three black-and-white paintings—including _Untitled_—with which she announced her dedication to the stark abstraction that would become her lifelong calling. Afterward, she said, “I never met a straight line I did not like.”

To make this work, Herrera painted vertical bands of black and white at varying lengths and with diagonal breaks that create a two-tone zigzag pattern. She extended her pattern to the face and sides of the frame, giving the object a sense of dynamic totality. ""I began a lifelong process of purification, a process of taking away what isn't essential,"" she explained. Although active in Paris and New York from the late 1940s on, she did not sell a painting until 2004, at the age of eighty-nine. She has recalled that one dealer bluntly told her, ""You can paint circles around the male artists that I have, but I'm not going to give you a show because you're a woman.""

Cady Noland,THE AMERICAN TRIP.,"Noland takes as a starting point the idea that the United States has historically embraced violence. “Violence used to be a part of life in America and had a positive reputation. . . . There was a kind of righteousness about violence—the break with England, fighting for our rights, the Boston Tea Party,” she has said. Through her sculptures, the artist asserts that this national connection to violence is by no means strictly in the past.
THE AMERICAN TRIP is an assemblage of objects that subtly allude to the relationship between statehood and violence. From a metal bar supported by three irregularly spaced stanchions hang chrome cuffs, leather straps once attached to police batons, and a wire hunting trap. Noland has paired the American Stars and Stripes with the Jolly Roger skull-and-crossbones flag that is traditionally associated with pirates. A white cane, which rests at an angle as if to take up more space, might be read as a symbol of the moral blindness of US policies. Made in the late 1980s, THE AMERICAN TRIP presents an art-historical reference to the industrial materials of 1960s Minimalist sculpture, but it departs from its abstract predecessors through its explicitly political commentary and potent psychological charge.

“Violence used to be a part of life in America,” Noland has said. “There was a kind of righteousness about violence—the break with England, fighting for our rights, the Boston Tea Party. Now, in our culture as it is . . . acts of violence, expressions of dissatisfaction are framed . . . as being ‘abnormal.’” In this work, the artist has assembled objects that point to the ways violence, far from an abnormality, continues to order life in the United States. Leather straps from police batons dangle  from a galvanized steel pipe; a wire hunting trap is positioned beside a pirate flag and the American flag, its bottommost corner skimming the ground; and a cane for the blind hangs diagonally, perhaps symbolizing the moral blindness of US policies.

Sérgio Camargo,Edge,"In this work Camargo highlights an optical and kinetic aesthetic without denying the natural features of material roughness: the artist has inserted one of his signature reliefs into the massive, elemental presence of a raw piece of wood. The raw material functions as a sculptural body, supporting the beautiful, vibrating surfaces typical of Camargo's repertoire. A dialogue is established between the body of the sculpture and its surface, between the organic textures of nature and the carefully crafted ornaments of art.

León Ferrari,Nosotros no sabíamos (We Didn't Know),"This is an incomplete summary of some of the articles that the newspapers published in 1976 about the first period of repression unleashed by the Videla military junta. They are articles that managed to get through the filter of censorship, or that were allowed to get through as messengers of terror. Although they are far from encompassing all of the crimes committed by our FFAA [Armed Forces], they give an idea of the climate that the population experienced and the level of knowledge had by those who justified the crimes with, “it will be for something,” the new criminal code of the oppressors and their parishes, an expression that after the trials they replaced with, “we did not know.”
Missing here, but which will be added, is the information that documents the complicity of a good part of the church, a complicity that continued when it asked for the pardon of the condemned and that manifested again when the Nuncio Calabresi invited those pardoned but not acquitted, to toast with the Cardinal Quarracino to the thirty years of the papacy of John Paul II, in October 1991.
From this material, which was compiled in 1976, four copies were published in Brazil that same year, three were published in 1984 also in São Paulo, Brazil, and four others for the exhibition “500 Years of Repression,” realized at the Centro Recoleta in August of 1992.

In one, the figure consults a picture in order to paint a large brain on the wall.

Garry Winogrand,Untitled from Women are Beautiful,"In an era when each roll of film contained 36 exposures and had to be rewound, removed from the camera, and processed, Garry Winogrand was extremely prolific: at his death, he left 2,500 rolls of undeveloped film and 300,000 unedited images. While the previous generation of documentary photographers made pictures in service of social causes, Winogrand and his peers believed that the everyday had value as a photographic subject. Through his distinct and idiosyncratic approach to the medium, he explored the ways in which the camera’s lens changes our vision of the world: “I photograph to see what the world looks like in photographs.”

Dara Birnbaum,Technology/Transformation: Wonder Woman,"American households in the late 1970s consumed, on average, over six hours of television per day. Around that time, Birnbaum began working with footage hijacked from television broadcasts. She re-edited material from the popular program Wonder Woman to emphasize how mass media alternates between heroic and trivializing depictions of women. “Where am I between the two?” Birnbaum has asked. “I’m a secretary, I’m a Wonder Woman, and there’s nothing
in-between. And the in-between is the reality we need to live in.” She installed the video in the storefront of a SoHo hair salon, for all to see.

Paul Chan,1st Light,"1st Light is the first in a series of seven animations titled The 7 Lights (2005–7), in which Paul Chan addresses themes of faith, technology, and politics. Described by the artist as “hallucinating the seven days of creation from dawn to dusk,” the cycle was created using obsolete computer-animation technology and is projected directly on the gallery floor.
Silhouettes of everyday objects and human forms pass across the surface, creating a dystopian shadow play seemingly cast by the light of an unseen window. The shadows of abandoned vehicles, utility poles, cell phones, and other debris ascend, while apparitions of bodies plunge from the sky. Chan’s ghostly, apocalyptic vision confronts us with a parable of terror and salvation that evokes the events of 9/11 and other calamities of the recent past. In the title, “light” is struck out, suggesting its impending absence.

Informed by the violent and politically tumultuous era of the 1940s and 1950s in which she grew up, her paintings, drawings, and sculptures mix popular and commercial forms with nods to ""high"" art, exploring political, social, and domestic subjects with equal insight. During the 1970s, González worked on a series of paintings executed in enamel on metal sheets mounted on mass-produced furniture. The image that appears in Canción de cuna (Lullaby) was taken from a collection of kitsch photographs distributed by a popular print company in Colombia. Found in the streets of Bogotá, the crib used in the sculpture once belonged to a public hospital. The iconic image of mother and child—a theme that has recurred throughout art history—is transformed by González into an ambiguous image of maternity, hinting at the sharp social observation that distinguishes her work.

Nam June Paik,Zen for Film,"During a concert on October 6, 1960, in Mary Bauermeister’s studio in Cologne, Germany, which included works by John Cage and La Monte Young, Paik performed his Étude for Piano Forte and, as part of the composition, shampooed Cage’s hair and cut off his necktie in an act of nihilistic affection. The relationship of Zen for Film to Cages 4’33” can be seen in its inviting the possibility of being aware of much within the limits of little. According to Cage, the film—devoid of images—opens itself up to the nuances of its surrounding environment, “and what you see is the dust that has collected on the film.”

"Louis Sullivan, Dankmar Adler","Stenciled Frieze Panel from the Trading Room of the Chicago Stock Exchange, Chicago, IL","Completed in 1894, Sullivan and Adler’s thirteen-story Chicago Stock Exchange was one of the earliest modern skyscrapers, rising to a new height made possible by developments in steel framing. The second-floor trading room was its magnificent centerpiece. When the building was demolished in 1972, architectural elements were salvaged and gathered by collectors and museums. This particular painted fragment features fifty-two distinct hues in muted tones of rust and gold, green and yellow. Shapes that recall root systems, stems, and leaves are transformed into stylized patterns that allude to prairie landscapes and the fundamental role of midwestern agriculture in the US economy. The rhythm and precision of the abstract design are also reminiscent of Islamic decorative traditions.
In its lush, organic motifs and intricately stenciled patterns, the frieze reflects Sullivan’s goal of synthesizing elements of nature with abstraction. Organic patterns portrayed at different scales and in various mediums were integrated throughout the entire building, arranged to emphasize the structure’s verticality. Motifs recurred in molded plaster and terra-cotta and in the ironwork of staircases and elevator grilles. Sullivan believed that decorative elements and architectural form could, and should, come together to create a unique and harmonious whole. Through his elaboration of a concept he called “organic ornamentation,” he paved the way for a distinctly American visual culture rooted in the simplicity of nature yet brimming with endless variations of architectural expression.

The Chicago Stock Exchange was among the earliest modern skyscrapers, rising to an unprecedented thirteen stories when it was completed in 1894. The trading room, where this element was installed, was its magnificent centerpiece. Salvaged when the building was demolished in 1972, this architectural fragment features fifty-two distinct hues in muted tones of rust and gold, green, and yellow.

Öyvind Fahlström,Mao-Hope March,"Transcription of Mao-Hope March
Wait a second! Let me see. I don't know. That isn't Bob Hope but I don't know who he is. I like Bob Hope, that's for sure.
Are you happy generally?
Oh yes, I love the television.
What makes you happy?
Television, because I'm very lonesome without....
Are you happy?
Very tough question. Up and down.
How about you, sir? Are you happy?
Yes, I just came back from Mexico. Why not? I went all through the States to Mexico,
why shouldn't I be happy? I went on that $99 thing that Greyhound gave out. I took every day the world what it was. So why shouldn't I be happy? And with this Bob Hope thing, I think it's a publicity campaign because he was on TV the other day and probably his book that he did or something about Russia.
And what's the connection with Mao Tse Tung?
The connection? That I wouldn't know now. Let's say he's in town for some sort of publicity, that's all.
Is Mao in town?
Bob Hope.
Oh, I thought you meant that Mao Tse Tung was in town.
No. Well not that I know of.
Was it a strike against something? Are they protesting somebody? They're running Bob Hope for some kind of political office?
There's somebody else's picture there, too.
Yeah, I don't recognize the other fellow. Recognize Bob Hope, though.
Who's the other fellow?
What is that? The Chinese general marshal? Whatever the fella's name is. Is that a Japanese? Is he Korean? What do you call it? President, General, whatever he is....
Who is he?
I see Bob Hope!
Am I happy? Sure, I'm the happiest person in the world.
Why?
Why? I've got my good health, I work, have a nice family, so why shouldn't I be happy?
What do you make out of that? Do you know?
I don't say. They're all sick in the head, maybe.
Are you a happy man?
Certainly! Do I look happy, huh?
Why?
Because I live the type of life I do.
What type of life is that?
The type that you don't.
Why are you happy?
No troubles, nothing to bother me. Nothing to worry about, right? I work, enjoy life....
You know, it really stops you, you know. It makes you sort of stop and wonder what is he running for? Because if you notice that most of these actors are going into politics now, like Ronald Reagan, for instance.
Whose pictures are they?
Bob Hope and I'm not sure of the other person, but it's, I think it's Mao Tse Tung.
Is there some kind of connection?
I hope not.
The only thing I can think of is that they're inferring that Bob Hope is a communist, but....
I wish I knew! Maybe the cops could help. I don't know. I was just thinking, maybe we ought to call Bob Hope and tell him about it.
If you know his number....
I can get it.
Does it make you unhappy?
Very! It doesn't make you happy, does it? Doesn't make you very happy, does it?
You seem to be unhappy.
Wouldn't you be? Well, tell me. Let me ask....
Are you unhappy?
Yes, very!
Well, I think something political, political going on with a picket line.
Are you generally a happy man?
All the time.
What makes you happy?
The whole world.
Is there anything that makes you unhappy?
Nothing.
Are they all pictures of Bob Hope?
Yeah.
No, no, there's one different. I don't know. One looks like what's-his-name from China.
The premiere, right? Chu? Is it Chu? Was it Chu?
Was it the premiere from China? Is it? Huh?
My boy is Bob Hope. I like Bob Hope. I don't like the other guy.
Are you happy?
Very happy.
Why?
Because I love this country and I love the people here and I'm very happy.
Are we on television?
No.
Bob Hope for president! Bing Crosby vice-president!
Is that Mao Tse Tung?
That's right!
Bing Crosby vice-president!
What's it all about?
I wouldn't know.
Can I ask you a question?
Yes, sir.
Are you happy?
Yes, sir.
What makes you happy?
What makes me happy? Seeing Bob Hope up there, for president. That's right! Make Bing Crosby vice-president. That's right! Bing Crosby vice-president! That's right!

Mao-Hope March shows a demonstration organized by Fahlström that took place on September 1, 1966, in New York. Seven young people marched down Fifth Avenue, along Central Park, carrying large placards: six with a photograph of American comedian Bob Hope, and one featuring Mao Zedong, chairman of the Communist Party of China. Curious onlookers wondered if the procession was a protest, or perhaps a publicity stunt, while radio personality Bob Fass recorded their answers to the question “Are you happy?” The commentary unfolds as a satiric study of global politics, celebrity culture, and the pursuit of happiness in Cold War America.

Mao-Hope March shows a demonstration organized by Fahlström that took place on September 1, 1966, in New York. A group of young people marched down Fifth Avenue, along Central Park, carrying placards with no text, six with photographs of the American comedian Bob Hope, and one of Mao Tse-tung, chairman of the Communist Party of China. Radio personality Bob Fass recorded people's comments and the answers to the question ""Are you happy?"" The casual and often humorous answers reveal the cultural concerns and political preoccupations of 1960s America. The film was made for inclusion in Fahlström's performance work Kisses Sweeter Than Wine, presented as part of the festival 9 Evenings: Theatre and Engineering at the 69th Regiment Armory in New York in 1966. By 1973, however, the artist had decided to present the film as an independent work.

In 2005, Druot, Lacaton, and Vassal won a government competition to remodel a 1961 public housing high-rise on the ring road that circles Paris. The original modernist prefabricated concrete tower had various shortcomings and was considered undesirable. After interviews with residents, the architects focused on expanding the living spaces and increasing natural light to improve conditions in each apartment. Their design adds a new exterior structure—a transparent glass shell of balconies that completely envelops the existing building, breaking up the monotony of the facade and providing much-needed insulation. It has made the radical reconfiguration of the apartments’ interiors possible; the addition of winter gardens has increased apartment footprints by roughly fifteen percent and provides both natural light and views. With their innovative and imaginative solution, the architects exemplify socially progressive retrofitting in a world of diminishing resources.

Dorothea Tanning,On Time Off Time,"A sense of menace pervades this work, in which a wooden structure that resembles the foundation of a house is set in a barren landscape, flanked by flames and billowing smoke. A shadow looms across the ground, cast by an unknown source, while, in the distance, a hovering sunflower—considered “the most aggressive of flowers” by the artist—creates its own black shadow.
Tanning painted On Time Off Time in the desert environment of Sedona, Arizona, having relocated there two years earlier with her husband, the artist Max Ernst. It was through Ernst that Tanning had previously met a cohort of Surrealist artists who had fled war-torn Europe and were living in New York. She gained their admiration for her singularly enigmatic images rendered in meticulous detail. Possible biographical clues in On Time Off Time include the depicted structure, which may bear echoes of the three-room cabin that Tanning and Ernst had built in the desert. Yet more than merely a setting, Sedona’s dramatic landscape proved to be generative, forcing Tanning to tune out the surrounding “decibels of nature,” which she found to be “crushing,” and to instead turn to fantasy. “Isn’t that the artist’s best joy,” she remarked, “to rival the sun and moon, to turn their logic upside down?”

Thomas Bayrle,Chairs Up,"In the 1960s, Bayrle developed a signature visual language of intricately patterned images. Drawing on his experience working in a weaving factory, he constructed tightly bound compositions, using images drawn from mass-media sources to create repeating rhythms. Exploring an optical play between figure and ground, Bayrle rendered his chosen icons—from a Volkswagen to film director Orson Welles—by tiling tiny pictures to generate both an overall pattern and a single image standing out against the background. This visual overload was a response to Germany’s exploding consumer culture in the 1960s and to the ease of reproducing images in the medium of screenprint. Bayrle was an important figure in German Pop art, and his work has been of great interest to the Museum. Due to the scarcity of available works, until recently the collection contained only one print by Bayrle. In 2010, the artist made a group of impressions available to MoMA from his personal archive.

Lee Ufan,From Line,"Lee, one of the leaders of the Mono-ha movement, which emerged in 1960s Tokyo, described the collective as “a group of artists who set out to make things be as they are.” In From Line, this credo is demonstrated in the natural exhaustion of paint pulled down the canvas over successive brushstrokes. The artist’s interest in minimizing skill and expertise, along with the repeated bodily movement necessary to accomplish the sequence of brushstrokes, let the relationship between the artistic process, the material, and the viewer unfold.

Twenty-nine lines move from fullness to invisibility in this painting. To create each dynamic trace, Lee paired Japanese powdered mineral pigments with Western canvas, dipping a brush in cobalt-blue paint and then pulling it across the support laid on the floor, in one continuous stroke. The gradually disappearing color also charts a physical transformation: the rich marks are densely saturated, nearly tactile, at the top but fade over the course of their run as the material thins.
Lee was born in Korea and trained in traditional Chinese ink painting. At age twenty he moved to Japan, where in the late 1960s he became a leader of a groundbreaking group of artists known as Mono-ha (School of Things), which pioneered site-specific sculpture and natural processes—powerfully engaging the physicality of the land in the face of postwar industrialization, authoritarianism, and globalization. Lee returned to painting in 1973, producing monochrome works (such as From Line) that relate the act of painting to that of making sculpture: shaping—and giving in to—matter, chemistry, gravity, and light. Indeed, due to the instability of the mediums Lee has used, many of these works no longer exist; From Line is a rare exception. To look at the painting is to slowly become aware of the separation between pigment particles, viscous oil, and woven canvas, as if the work were evaporating before your eyes.

Frank Lloyd Wright,"Exterior frieze from the Dana House, Springfield, IL","The Susan Lawrence Dana House, one of Wright’s earliest projects, afforded him the opportunity to experiment with design and construction techniques that would become emblematic of his Prairie Style architecture. Though many European modernists shunned exterior ornament, American practitioners like Wright used it liberally to accentuate structure, with a proclivity toward geometric abstractions of nature.

Wright, born in Wisconsin and based in Chicago, is known for developing Prairie Style architecture, which is characterized by low, horizontal roofs, gently sloped gables, rows of continuous windows, wide overhanging eaves, a central hearth, an open plan, and undisguised building materials. The Dana House, one of Wright’s earliest projects, afforded him the opportunity to experiment with many design and construction techniques he would implement in his later works. Though many European modernists shunned exterior ornament, American practitioners like Wright used it liberally to accentuate structure, with a proclivity toward geometric abstractions of nature. Applied on the upper portions of the exterior, the decorative frieze wraps around the house, forming a richly patterned skin derived from the shape of sumac leaves—a thematic ornamental element applied throughout the house on windows, lamps, and decorative objects.

Grete Stern,Dream No. 1: Electrical Appliances for the Home,"Among Stern’s most significant artistic accomplishments are her Sueños, or Dreams, a series of photomontages that she contributed weekly from 1948 to 1951 to the Argentine women’s magazine Idilio. Stern’s works accompanied a column titled El psicoanálisis le ayudará (Psychoanalysis will help you), which reflected the considerable interest in psychoanalysis in the period immediately following World War II. Edited by sociologist Gino Germani under the pen name Richard Rest, it provided psychoanalytic views on the dreams of working-class women, many of whom were inspired to seek upward mobility by the glamour and populist ideology of President Juan Domingo Perón and his second wife, Eva Perón.
Approaching her assignments through a filmmaker’s lens, Stern delivered an entire narrative within a single frame. In Dream No. 1: Electrical Appliances for the Home, an elegantly dressed woman has been converted into the base of a table lamp about to be turned on by a male hand; electricity, here, is a metaphor for sexuality that connects to female objectification. Plumbing the depths of her own experience as a mother and an artist, Stern negotiated between privacy and exposure, blissful domesticity and a sense of entrapment, cultural sexism and intellectual rebellion. Behind a layer of playfulness, her work mobilized viewers to resist the pleasures and discontents of prescribed gender roles in mid-twentieth-century Argentine society and gave voice to the hidden repressions expressed in women’s dreams.

Behind a layer of playfulness, this photomontage expresses a sense of urgency about giving voice to the hidden desires expressed in women's dreams.

Seth Price,Essay with Knots,"“Suppose an artist were to release the work directly into a system that depends on reproduction and distribution for its sustenance, a model that encourages contamination, borrowing, stealing, and horizontal blur?” Price posed this question in his essay “Dispersion” in 2002, when digital technology was beginning to fundamentally change the way art and ideas are distributed around the globe. The essay has circulated in various forms, including a printed book, a PDF available online at http://sethpricestudio.com/writingarchive/DIspersion.pdf, and this work, in which Price’s Adobe InDesign files are printed on plastic formed around knotted ropes using industrial packaging technology.

Essay with Knots consists of nine panels of vacuum-formed plastic, across which is printed an essay entitled ""Dispersion,"" which Price began writing in 2002. The essay explores the profound changes in the creation and experience of art that have accompanied the growth of digital technology, and the ways in which artists are addressing these new possibilities for the production and diffusion of information. Price has circulated the piece in various forms, including the sculptural work on view here, in which the artist's Adobe InDesign files are printed on plastic and formed around knotted ropes using industrial packaging technology; a printed book available in stores; and a free PDF of the book available online. By positioning the work within different economic spheres—the art world, the retail market, and the free economy of the Internet—Price creates multiple possibilities of presentation that are all equally ""the work.""

Jiro Takamatsu,Slack of Net,"Takamatsu’s primary materials here are cotton rope and twine—materials that, the artist explained, “one could find anywhere.

Newsreel images—mass rallies, monuments, and a public address by Yugoslav President Tito—alternate with footage of the artist cutting holes into a sheer black stocking pulled over her face, like the DIY version of a militant’s balaclava. For Iveković, the repeated act of cutting into fabric is emblematic of film- and video-editing strategies such as montage. Revealing the insidiousness of national propaganda and questioning the unified stories told through official channels, she frames historical events as inextricably linked to human ones, ending the video with her face fully uncovered.

Dan Graham,Alteration to a Suburban House,"Alteration to a Suburban House is a speculative project that raises questions about the boundaries between public and private, the concepts of “inside” and “outside,” and the “traditional disposition of the family space,” as Graham has written. The facade of a house in an apparently typical American suburb has been replaced by glass, while the house’s interior is divided into public and private sections by a mirror. In doing so, Graham critiques the modernist ideal that the literal transparency of glass in architecture would also lead to social transparency. At the same time that the house’s inhabitants can gaze at the environment and activity outside, they themselves become objects on display.

Here, the front facade of a house in an apparently typical American suburb has been replaced by glass, and a piece of mirror divides this otherwise very ordinary house into public and private sections. In this situation, the inhabitants of the dwelling would be visible through the enlarged picture window, but they themselves could gaze at the environment and activity outside. Alteration to a Suburban House is a seminal work of both art and architecture, raising questions about transparency and the boundaries between public and private and inside and outside using the format of the architectural model. Together with the reflections on repetition and banality typical of his early work, Graham introduced a critique of the modernist trope that the literal transparency of glass in architecture would lead to social transparency.

László Moholy-Nagy,EM 1 (Telephone Picture),"These works were produced by an enamel factory in Weimar, Germany, according to instructions given by the artist. Moholy-Nagy later wrote that he placed the order by telephone, thus providing the paintings with their unofficial title. While the three works share an identical abstract, geometric composition, EM 1, EM 2, and EM 3 were made at large, medium, and small scale, respectively. Each painting’s glossy enamel surface features a single strip of black that extends from top to bottom and two abstract shapes formed by lines of various thicknesses that intersect perpendicularly.
After encountering the work of the Russian avant-garde at an exhibition in Berlin in the early 1920s, Moholy-Nagy was persuaded by these artists’ belief that a revolutionary society demanded a radically new artistic language. He incorporated these ideas into his teaching at the Bauhaus, the influential German school of art, architecture, and design founded in Weimar in 1919 whose curriculum embraced modern technology as integral to art. By rejecting unique, handmade artwork in favor of serial mechanical production in his “telephone pictures,” Moholy-Nagy emphasized the role of the modern artist as a producer of concepts rather than a craftsman physically involved in the making of the work.

The artist seamlessly combined news photographs of violent battlefields in Vietnam with glossy advertisements for American luxury homes; layered images of soldiers with empty silhouettes of bodies; and spliced pictures of burials with those of military marches. By creating shocking contrasts between the destruction abroad and affluence at home, Rosler made visible the horrors of the “living-room war,” so called because the news of carnage in Southeast Asia only reached Americans via heavily filtered television reports. Rosler originally distributed her photomontages as flyers at anti-war demonstrations. “I saw House Beautiful not as art,” she later reflected. “I want it to be agitational.”

Niki de Saint Phalle,Shooting Painting American Embassy,"Saint Phalle created Shooting Painting American Embassy during “Homage to David Tudor,” a performance program she staged, with the artists Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, and Jean Tinguely, at the theater of the American Embassy in Paris on June 20, 1961. Over the course of the evening, each artist deployed strategies of indeterminacy—actions whose results are left open to chance—to make works onstage in front of an audience.
For her contribution, Saint Phalle hired a sharpshooter to fire a rifle at paint-filled balloons attached to a slab of wood covered in white plaster and paint with various objects encrusted in it; the bursting balloons created streams of brightly colored pigment that poured down over the work’s surface. A toy gun, a bucket seat, a hatchet, and an old shoe are among the items that were absorbed and reimagined as the stuff of painting.
This work is one of Saint Phalle’s “shooting paintings,” a series, begun in February of 1961, that repositioned the art of painting and assemblage as something explicitly violent. The sole female member of the Nouveaux Réalistes (New Realists) group, which championed the “poetic recycling of urban, industrial, and advertising reality,” Saint Phalle was a key figure among a generation of artists exploring the potential of found and everyday objects through performance-based practice.

Senga Nengudi,R.S.V.P. I,"Nengudi’s R.S.V.P. I is a sculptural environment composed entirely of two ordinary materials: pantyhose and sand. The pantyhose—ten worn pairs—are tacked onto and stretched between two walls in the corner of a room: the taut nylon mesh evokes spidery limbs, while the center gusset, filled with sand, is twisted and knotted into bulging sacks that sag toward the ground. R.S.V.P. I highlights the formal concerns of abstract sculpture, such as weight, tension, and spatial relations, yet is undeniably redolent of fleshy associations, particularly those of the female body. Referring to her works as “abstracted reflections of used bodies,” Nengudi created R.S.V.P. I in part as a response to the changes her body had undergone during pregnancy and as a rumination on the more gradual physical transformations that come with age.
R.S.V.P. I was included in Nengudi’s eponymous exhibition at New York’s Just Above Midtown Gallery in 1977, a commercial enterprise on Fifty-Seventh Street that had opened three years earlier with the mission of representing African American artists. As implied by the title—the commonly used French acronym for “please respond”—the objects on view were meant to be interacted with, not merely observed passively. Indeed, Nengudi and artist Maren Hassinger, her frequent collaborator, staged performances during the run of the show in which they probed and manipulated the sculptures.

R.S.V.P. I followed Nengudi’s first pregnancy and her experience of watching her changing body. “I am working with nylon mesh because it relates to the elasticity of the human body,” she explained. “From tender, tight beginnings to sagging… the body can only stand so much push and pull until it gives way, never to resume its original shape.” The sculptural installation debuted in 1977 at Just Above Midtown, a gallery that focused on work made by African American artists. During the exhibition, R.S.V.P. I functioned as a performative object for Nengudi and others, who would entangle themselves in its limb-like forms, stretching the pantyhose even further and reaching for the swollen pockets of sand.

Martin Wong,Stanton near Forsyth Street,"In 1978 Wong moved to New York, where he began to paint the neighborhoods of downtown Manhattan. Stanton near Forsyth Street is one of his signature Lower East Side cityscapes, in which brown-brick tenement buildings rise amid abandoned lots, refuse, and graffiti-covered surfaces. Two small figures appear in the foreground: on the left is a self-portrait of the artist, and on the right is Miguel Piñero, the Nuyorican poet and playwright who was Wong's frequent collaborator and romantic partner. The artist's stylized fingerspellings, a recurring visual idiom in his work that is appropriated from American Sign Language, scroll across the upper part of the painting.

Adrian Piper,What Will Become of Me,"In the 1980s Piper’s interests in systemic oppression, racism, and social justice took a contemplative and self-referential direction.

Completing the work are two typewritten documents that provide context for these artifacts: one a recountal of personal trauma, and the other a statement of intent on what becomes of the work upon the death of the artist.

Antonio Dias,The Invented Country (God-Will-Give-Days),"Dias occupies a central place in Brazilian art of the 1960s and 1970s. He left Brazil in 1966 and arrived in Paris in time to participate in the May 1968 protests. Because of his political involvement he was forced to move again; he settled in Milan, where he became the only Latin American member of the Arte Povera movement, whose adherents deployed common materials to counter art's increasing commodification. The Invented Country speaks to Dias's personal situation as well as to the political conditions of the moment. Produced while he was traveling in Nepal, the work was originally shown in an abandoned building in Milan that had been taken over by a commune of squatters. It suggests that, in the words of the artist, ""ideology had gone fishing."" Dias has presented the work as an emblem of failed state-sponsored revolutions and of the smaller utopian experiments that replaced them.

Beauford Delaney,Composition 16,"In 1953, at the age of fifty-two, Delaney left New York for Paris, where he would live for the rest of his life. Delaney did not begin to paint gestural abstractions such as this one until after this move. He began Composition 16 the following year, the “16” probably meaning that this was his sixteenth painting in Paris. Using densely applied oils to paint ribbonlike swirls in greens, reds, and yellows—colors that would dominate his palette in both abstract and figurative works over the next two decades—Delaney realized his goal to “remember the sculpture and structure of color.”

Isa Genzken,Painting,"“Fragility can be a very beautiful thing, more beautiful than something that is obviously made to last forever,” Genzken has said about her fascination with ruins. Painting belongs to a series of freestanding concrete sculptures on high steel pedestals that Genzken began making in the late 1980s. The work resembles a building fragment, a motif reflecting her upbringing in a Germany devastated by war. It also commemorates the Berlin Wall, whose demolition, in 1989, changed Germany’s ideological landscape as well as its physical one.

Shambhavi,Cosmic Seeds Light / Beej Brahmaand Ek,"Seeds fall on earth to be embraced, nurtured and nourished by it. They break out to form magnificent visions that sustain and take us out of the mundane into the realm of an extraordinary, magical, mystical, where everything is inter-connected. Out of the seed the cosmos is born. If we listen carefully we can hear the soft whisper with which each seed returns to earth to grow and keep us alive. We are all nurtured by the trinity of the farmer, water and earth. In the lonely the furrow of the farmer, set against burdens of labour, exile and a lifetime of toil, is the core of our existence whether we are conscious of it or not.
It is the profound experience that artist Shambhavi brings to us through a very simple gesture – singularity. The five elements, earth, water, fire, air and the sky all exist within the Brahmaand, the cosmos. This is the essence seed of our existence.

Käthe Kollwitz,Frontal Self-Portrait (Selbstbildnis von vorn),"In this searing self-portrait, Kollwitz homes in tightly on her face, isolating her careworn features and grave expression. Brooding introspection permeates Kollwitz's work, which is, at its core, an expression of compassion for her fellow man, especially for the suffering of women, children, and the poor in Germany during the cataclysmic years before, during, and after the two world wars. She dedicated herself to printmaking, believing that it was the medium best suited to social and political commentary. Self-portraiture was an important recurring subject in her oeuvre, and these intense, almost confrontational images are particularly powerful examples.
This woodcut and a lithograph, acquired in 2012, join an etching, already in the collection, to create a dramatic group of self-portraits from three different decades in three different mediums—each of which, in its own way, conveys the force of the artist's self-scrutiny over the course of her career.

Yayoi Kusama,Accumulation No. 1,"To make Accumulation No. 1, her first sculpture, Kusama covered an armchair with scores of hand-sewn stuffed and painted protrusions, which she referred to as phalluses. “I make them and make them and then keep on making them, until I bury myself in the process. I call this obliteration.” When she first exhibited this work in New York, her home throughout the 1960s, critics were, perhaps not surprisingly, shocked by the sexualized transformation of an ordinary domestic object by a female artist.

        Additional text






Accumulation No. 1 is the first in an ongoing series of presciently feminist sculptures by Kusama. When the twenty-nine-year-old artist arrived in New York from Japan in 1958, she had already developed what she called an “infinity net” motif: a signature pattern of interlocking cellular forms that she painted on room-size canvases with the stated goal of covering “the entire world.” This ambitious fantasy spurred her to expand the infinity net and its variants—repeated dots and phallic protuberances—into three dimensions. In 1962 she began a group of sculptures composed of household furniture that she covered with stuffed and hand-sewn canvas phalluses and then painted. Though their sexual explicitness is hard to ignore, critics at the time prudishly avoided any mention of this aspect of the works.
Kusama made Accumulation No. 1 in her Manhattan loft, which was located in the same downtown building as the studio of her friend the artist Claes Oldenburg. An early example of soft sculpture, it resonates closely with Oldenburg’s stuffed canvas sculptures of supersized domestic objects made around the same time. It was shown at the Green Gallery in New York in late 1962, along with works by Oldenburg and others, in what was widely considered the first group exhibition to focus on Pop art.

		Publication excerpt from MoMA Highlights: 375 Works from The Museum of Modern Art, New York (New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 2019)
	




""My sofas, couches, dresses, and rowboats bristle with phalluses,” Kusama once said. The “phalluses” to which she refers are swatches of cotton duck canvas, stuffed with cotton and coated with enamel paint—the same materials used by the most celebrated men of the New York avant-garde, including Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning. The plump armchair in _Accumulation No. 1_—Kusama’s first sculpture—bursts with limp phalluses of varying lengths. In keeping with the repetition so central to her process, she hand-sewed each one of these protrusions. Critics were shocked by her humorous, sexualized transformation of an ordinary domestic object. Kusama explained that she “began making penises in order to heal my feelings of disgust towards sex. Reproducing the objects…was my way of conquering the fear.” It was also her way of disempowering the repressive patriarchal society she left behind in Japan and the machismo that then dominated the New York art world.

Jimmie Durham,"The Cathedral of St. John the Divine in Manhattan is the World’s Largest Gothic Cathedral. Except, of course, that it is a fake; first by the simple fact of being built in Manhattan, at the turn of the century. But the stone work is re-inforced with steel which is expanding with rust. Someday it will destroy the stone. The Cathedral is in Morningside Heights overlooking a panoramic view of Harlem which is separated by a high fence.","“Coyote, who invented death and singing, was the spirit who gave me my name,” Durham wrote in 1984. “As is often the case, he also gave me a gift: that I would always see whatever was dead if it were within my field of vision. . . . It became necessary to see if that was a usable gift or just a dirty trick that would drive me crazy.” Working in New York in the 1980s, Durham assumed the role of the Coyote—a trickster or scavenger figure in the lore of many North American indigenous peoples—foraging for bones and other materials to create patchwork figures. Here, he embellishes a moose skull with paint and replaces one of its horns with a metal pipe. Found in a dumpster near the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, the skull is mounted on a wooden structure that at once functions as the moose’s skeleton and resembles the scaffolding encountered on city streets.

Lynda Benglis,Modern Art,"In late 1969, Benglis made a group of works by pouring colored liquid latex on the floor and letting it dry into irregular, rubbery chunks. Soon after, she began subjecting liquid metals to the same methods, pouring them into freestanding sculptures. Works such as _Modern Art_—which was executed in bronze, aluminum, lead and tin—share industrial materials with their Minimalist antecedents, yet their forms are also insistently biomorphic, even scatological. Modern Art consists of four parts, each in a different metal, but the work was divided for some twenty-five years: The bronze and aluminum parts were given to the Museum in 1977. The artist reunited the four elements of the work by donating the tin parts in 2012.

David Hammons,Untitled (Night Train),"Untitled (Night Train) is one of a series of circular or semicircular sculptures that Hammons fashioned from liquor bottles collected from the streets and vacant lots of New York. The graceful arching ring of clear and green-tinted bottles is embedded in a circular pile of coal. Each element is emblematic: the bottles are those of the cheapest popular brands of alcohol in the late 1980s, Night Train and Thunderbird, and the coal reinforces the work’s allusion to trains, an image that figures prominently in African American culture and lore.
“Outrageously magical things happen when you mess around with a symbol,” Hammons has reflected. Since the 1960s, the artist’s many assemblages have engaged questions of African American identity, urban culture, and racial stereotypes through the use of evocative, frequently discarded materials such as hair clippings, paper bags, and basketballs. Often the works also represent pointed visual puns. Here, for example, the triangulation of materials and words—“Night Train” and coal—can be combined to form the name Coltrane, a salute to the renowned African American jazz saxophonist and composer, while the Thunderbird bottles allude to another great jazz saxophonist, Charlie “Bird” Parker.

Edwards made The Lifted X in 1965, the year of the assassination of Malcolm X, the establishment of the Black Arts Movement, and the Watts Rebellion—six days of civic uprising in a predominantly black neighborhood of Los Angeles, the city where Edwards lived and worked. Titled upon completion in remembrance of the slain civil rights activist, the imposing sculpture, made from gnarled, welded steel balanced within and atop a rectangular steel armature, seems to have been born from the turbulence of its time.
Edwards learned to weld in 1960, and in 1963 he began his ongoing Lynch Fragments series of small wall reliefs. Between two and three Lynch Fragments form the central body of The Lifted X. Unified in medium, the metal elements are not obviously parts of earlier works or other objects; in this way, Edwards’s sculptures sidestep the category of assemblage, though not entirely its technique. Completely abstract except for the unmistakable meat hook hanging in clear view, the sculpture evokes an instrument of torture. “When important persons die, they rise,” Edwards has said. According to the artist, in death Malcolm X became a martyr: assassination only expanded the significance of his words and actions. In this context, rather than a symbol of mourning or a torture device, The Lifted X is a triumphant object of defiance.

Betye Saar,Black Girl's Window,"Black Girl’s Window is a pivotal work from the first decade of Saar’s career, marking the moment when her practice shifted from primarily printmaking to collage and assemblage. The work weaves together references to the private, the public, and the mystical. A salvaged weathered wooden window frame isolates and surrounds a series of nine small vignettes in the upper half of the composition. Under depictions of stars and phases of the moon are a phrenological chart, a representation of Leo (Saar’s astrological sign), a daguerreotype, and, in the center, a pair of skeletons. Below and separate from this collection of symbols is a large silhouetted figure painted on the verso of a pane of glass. Flat against a blue background and a set of sheer curtains, this figure presses up against a transparent yet rigid and unyielding surface. Its facial features are hidden in shadow, with the exception of two eyes cut from a lenslike material that creates the illusion that they open and close as the viewer moves around them.
Saar has acknowledged the self-referential nature of the assemblage: “Even at the time, I knew it was autobiographical,” she has said. “We’d had the Watts Riots and the Black revolution. Also that was the year of my divorce. So in addition to the occult subject matter there was political and also personal content.”

Today known as the SESC Pompéia, the complex features classrooms and reading areas, restaurants and bars, a theater, and a sports block. “Cave mouths” have been inserted into walls as windows while eight pathways bridge various facilities. The project was the culmination of Bo Bardi’s embrace of a principle she termed “the civilization of survival,” in which she created non-hierarchical, democratic civic spaces in previously inhospitable urban contexts.

Julije Knifer,Meander No. 5,"Unlike other countries behind the Iron Curtain, Yugoslavia did not enforce Socialist Realism—characterized by romanticized depictions of communist life—as the official state style, allowing artists to continue working within a tradition of abstraction. It was in this context that Croatian artist Julije Knifer created the ""meander,""a serpentine black line on a white field or a white line on a black field, which he painted exclusively from 1960 until his death in 2004. For Knifer, this concentration on a single motif at once extended the formal radicalism of pre-war abstraction and subverted the utopian political goals that often accompanied it. Knifer's meander does not construct a better society: it is a useless gesture, emptied of meaning.

Serge Chermayeff,Radio (model AC74),"These radio sets departed from the styling of early domestic radios as bulky pieces of furniture. In keeping with company founder E. K. Cole's view of radio as a modern medium, the geometric and unadorned design of the cabinets highlighted rather than disguised their essential componentsthe speaker and tuning knobs. EKCO was an early adopter of Bakelite, a synthetic plastic material that could be industrially molded, and approached several well-known modernist architects to design receivers suited to this modern technology. Plastics also made relatively lightweight, compact designs possible (the Chermayeff set was equipped with handles for portability).

Sam Gilliam,10/27/69,"In 1968—the year of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and the signing of the Civil Rights Act—Gilliam began staining and folding raw canvases and suspending them from the wall, creating immersive bleeds of color. For Gilliam, “the year 1968 was one of revelation . . . something was in the air, and it was in that spirit that I did the Drape paintings.” The works’ tension and free fall—subject to forces beyond the artist’s control—paralleled the social turmoil of the time. As a Black artist and civil rights leader, Gilliam deliberately worked against the grain. Unlike many of his peers, he refrained from literal depictions or messages in his art. He was committed to abstraction, stating, “the expressive act of making a mark and hanging it in space is always political. My work is as political as it is formal.” Gilliam’s titles refer to historical and artistic events alike: 10/27/69 marks the date he completed this painting, against the backdrop of mass demonstrations protesting the Vietnam War.

        Additional text






As an African American artist who remained committed to abstraction during the height of the civil rights movement, Gilliam deliberately worked against the grain. He is best known for unstretched abstract paintings that he drapes from the ceiling, slings over sawhorses, or, as is the case here, pins to the wall. They range from mural-size canvases to a small single sheet hung like a towel on a doorknob.
In this work, the cloth is gathered at three points and nailed to the wall, which allows its shape—two primary folds—to be dictated by gravity. Its complex surface is the result of several different methods of applying paint, including soaking, splattering, and folding the fabric onto itself. The work bears swaths and streaks of peachy oranges and yellows overlaid with violet and red that appear to have been rubbed into the canvas. On the right, purple and indigo shades dominate, offset by a large patch of yellow in the bottom corner.
In his earliest paintings, made in the mid-1960s, Gilliam depicted geometric abstractions on traditionally stretched canvases that resemble those of the Washington Color School painters of the 1950s, ’60s, and ’70s, with whom he exhibited. Soon, however, these works gave way to the fluid drips and splatters that came to define his signature draped works. Delineating actual space with their accordion-like folds, much like sculpture, these works invite viewers to consider painting as an immersive experience.

Gilliam is best known for unstretched abstractions that he drapes from the ceiling, slings over sawhorses, or, as is the case here, pins to the wall. Ranging in size from a small single sheet hung like a towel on a doorknob to mural-sized canvases, Gilliam's ""drapes"" were reportedly inspired by the artist's observation of laundry hanging outside his window. In this work, the cloth is gathered at three points and nailed to the wall, which allows its shape to be dictated by gravity. Its complex surface is the result of several different methods of applying paint, including stain-soaking, splattering, and folding the fabric onto itself to create a tie-dyed effect.

Terry Adkins,Methane Sea,"A welded steel structure draped with tangled ropes wedged with fids (conical wooden tools used on boats to secure lines and sails), Methane Sea was featured in the last exhibition of Adkins’s work organized during his lifetime, Nenuphar, which explored obscure affinities between the African-American scientist and inventor George Washington Carver (1864–1943) and the French artist Yves Klein (1928–1962). Adkins explained that _Methane Sea “_had to do with [their] different relationships to the sea and to ships.” Carver was born a slave and Klein was from the maritime city of Nice. Adkins continued, “Both of them . . . dealt in abstract worlds . . . and both of them dealt with microscopic and macroscopic things.”

Howardena Pindell,Memory: Past,"Memory: Past is made from strips of canvas sewn into rows and nailed directly to the wall. In a time-intensive and laborious process, The artist built up layers of paint, dye, and powder to create this rose-colored abstract work. The top of the composition is punctuated by photo fragments and shimmering glitter. Pindell, who worked as the first Black woman curator at MoMA in the decade before she made this painting, occasionally visited the Museum’s frame shop, where she would collect materials for her art.

Conceived as “an emergency exit leading people to another realm,” the work consisted of a translucent, inflatable orb precariously protruding from the classical eighteenth-century facade of Kassel’s Fridericianum. Theatrically staged as an artificial oasis, the orb contained two plastic palm trees, a hammock, and a red flag. By temporarily extending the institutional space of the museum beyond its architectural confines, Haus-Rucker-Co altered the experiences of visitors and questioned the artificial demarcation between natural and human-made environment.

Robert H. McNeill,Make a Wish,"When McNeill received a tip that Fortune magazine was seeking photographs related to domestic workers, he sought out an area where day laborers gathered known as the “Bronx Slave Market.” The pictures ultimately appeared in Flash, a Washington, DC–based “weekly newspicture magazine” geared toward African American audiences. “It was the small things that struck me,” McNeill recalled. “The idea that this woman had come up from the South, maybe was staying with relatives in New York and needed to help pay the rent, and ended up doing what she had known in the South. Or the expression on the white woman’s face, after she offers to pay 15 cents [an hour] and [the other woman] says, ‘Uh-uh, 20 cents is my price.’ I guess the pictures were too strong for Fortune, though, because they were never used.”

Carlos Zilio,Untitled,"Cerco e morte (Siege and Death) features two diagrams. In each a group of four arrows forms a cross: on the left, the arrows nearly touch eachother and constitute a siege; on the right, the arrows touch at the center point and indicate death. Painted black against a white background, the work is a stark graphic composition that conveys a radical political statement—a political assassination—made in the heated context of the early 1970s in Brazil. Zilio was a renowned intellectual, artist, and political activist in the late 1960s, and a key member of the Brazilian art scene, working alongside Antonio Dias and Hélio Oiticica to establish the foundations of contemporary art in Brazil.

Marta Minujín,MINUCODE,"*MINUCODE—*a blend of the artist’s name and the word “code”—was commissioned by the Center for Inter-American Relations (now the Americas Society) in New York in 1968. Interested in exploring the social codes of the arts, business, fashion, and politics, Marta Minujín decided she would host four cocktail parties attended by people working in those fields. She enlisted participants via newspaper advertisements, which described the work as a “social environment” and included a precise yet playful questionnaire inviting responders to categorize themselves according to their occupation and interests.
Minujín received over 1,000 replies, from which guest lists were created. The parties took place over four consecutive nights at the CIAR, where participants were filmed and then invited back a few days later to see the films projected onto the walls of the gallery. Transforming the space into an immersive architecture of moving images, Minujín later reflected, “I wanted them to see themselves ‘backward,’ to observe their own behaviors, to watch their own social interactions.”

Richard Serra,Equal,"Since the 1960s, the sculptor Richard Serra has explored the basic properties of his medium through the most straightforward yet extraordinary means. Rather than concern himself with images, Serra studies form, including its mass, weight, ability to delineate space, and the ways it behaves under the pressures of gravity. As a result, his sculptures produce in us a heightened awareness of our surroundings.
Equal consists of eight forged steel boxes stacked in pairs. Each box measures five by five and a half by six feet and weighs forty tons in a rectangular cube. To diferentiate one stack from another, Serra has rotated the position of the shorter and longer sides of the boxes. Despite the varying orientation of the individual components, each stack measures eleven feet tall. This simple construction—one block sitting atop another—yields a variety of experiences; the massive sculpture may overwhelm the viewer and, in this sublimity, invite contemplation.

Gretchen Bender,Dumping Core,"Gretchen Bender worked in the commercial sphere on music videos, advertisements, and television shows while simultaneously making art that critiqued the media culture within which she operated. Her work experience made her skeptical of the latest mass communication technologies, including television, which she saw as the next frontier for visual expression and psychological oppression: “I think of the media as a cannibalistic river,” she said three years after completing Dumping Core. “There is no consciousness or mind. It’s about absorbing and converting.”
Bender conceived Dumping Core as a theatrical presentation complete with live electronic music. It lives on as a gallery installation in which she programmed four videos to play in varying combinations across 13 synchronized monitors. “I’ll mimic the media—but I’ll turn up the voltage on the currents so high that hopefully it will blast criticality out there,” she has explained. The screens pulse with an overload of repeating television graphics, corporate logos, and clips appropriated from advertisements, TV programs, and movies. Bender titled the work after an early computing term, “core dump,” which is a recording of a computer’s memory captured just before it crashes.

        Additional text






In Dumping Core, a frenzy of images appears across thirteen video monitors, creating an information overload set to a proto-techno soundtrack. The installation mimics and exaggerates the pervasive media culture prompted by
then-new television networks like CNN and MTV. As Bender said, “I quickly got caught up in the way in which TV moves,
the current. . . . From that equivalent flow I tried to force some kind of consciousness of underlying patterns of social control.” By rapidly intercutting computer-generated logos, graphics, and other clips from TV and movies, the artist sought to subvert corporate agendas and expose the rampant use of new image-making technologies for commercial gain.
The work’s title refers to a computer error called a “core dump” and also alludes to the 1979 accident at Three Mile Island, capturing fears of technological dystopia and nuclear annihilation. Conceived and staged as a work of “electronic theater”—and originally performed during a single evening—Dumping Core demanded a close look at the power of televisual media at a nascent moment of the rapidly accelerating digital age.

Carolee Schneemann,Four Fur Cutting Boards,"In the early 1960s, Schneemann began to experiment with performance and dance, extending her paintings into time and space. Four Fur Cutting Boards is both a moving sculpture, activated by spectators, and a stage backdrop. Its title refers to her studio, which was housed in an old furrier’s shop in Manhattan. The same year, Schneemann photographed herself—naked, her face and body painted—interacting with the work. Presenting herself as both the work’s maker and a part of it, subject and object, she held a “double knowledge”—a concern that would also characterize the work of many other artists influenced by feminism.

Terry Adkins,Dark Night,"A wooden box sheathed with bands of oxidized copper and topped with brass and stretched rawhide, Dark Night evokes the form of a drum. The work is part of a series of sculptures Adkins began in 1986 while at an artist residency in Zurich, during which he founded the Lone Wolf Recital Corps. These sculptures anticipated Adkins’s later installations incorporating the display and performance of variously manipulated or invented instruments and musical machines. “Embedded in the sculpture is the trace of sound, the trace of the nature of sound, even if the sculptures aren’t sounding,” Adkins said of these works.

Shigetaka Kurita,Emoji,"In 1999 the Japanese mobile phone company NTT DOCOMO released a set of 176 emoji for mobile phones and pagers. Designed on a twelve-by-twelve-pixel grid, the emoji—a portmanteau of the Japanese words e, or “picture,” and moji, or “character”—enhanced the visual interface for NTT DOCOMO’s devices and facilitated the nascent practice of text messaging and mobile email. Drawing on sources as varied as Japanese graphic novels, the typeface Zapf Dingbats, and common emoticons (simple faces that computer users made out of preexisting punctuation marks), Kurita, a designer at NTT DOCOMO, included illustrations of weather phenomena, pictograms like the heart symbol, and a range of facial expressions.
The shift toward concise, telegraphic correspondence that began with the advent of email in the 1970s accelerated dramatically when messaging moved to mobile devices. People had even less space and time to get their point across, and the conveyance of tone and emotion became both more difficult and more urgent. Emoji, when combined with text, allow for more nuanced intonation. Filling in for body language, they reassert the human within the deeply impersonal, abstract space of electronic communication. Now, with more than 2,600 in use, emoji have evolved far beyond NTT DOCOMO’s original set into an essential, global, and increasingly complex companion to written language. Nonetheless, the DNA for today’s emoji is clearly present in Kurita’s humble pixelated designs.

In 1999 the Japanese telecom NTT DOCOMO released the original 176 emoji (e meaning “picture” and moji “character”) for mobile phones and pagers. Designed on a simple 12 × 12 pixel grid by Shigetaka Kurita, emoji enhanced the visual interface for DOCOMO’s devices and facilitated the rise of the nascent practice of text messaging and mobile email. Drawing on varied sources including manga, Zapf dingbats, and commonly used emoticons (simple faces made out of pre-existing glyphs), Kurita’s set included illustrations of weather phenomena, pictograms, and a range of expressive faces. Simple, elegant, and incisive, Kurita’s emoji planted the seeds for the explosion of a new visual language.
The shift toward concise, telegraphic correspondence that began with the advent of email in the 1970s accelerated dramatically when messaging moved to mobile. The abridged nature of mobile communication tends to obscure tone and emotion. Emoji, when combined with text, allow for more nuanced intonation. Filling in for body language, they reassert the human in the abstract space of electronic communication.
Today, with nearly 1,800 in use, emoji are an increasingly complex companion to written language. Kurita’s emoji are powerful manifestations of the capacity of design to alter human behavior. Just as the design of a chair dictates our posture, so, too, do the designs of various formats of electronic communication shape our voice. Although emoji have advanced far beyond Kurita’s original 176 designs, the DNA for today’s emoji is clearly present in Kurita’s humble, pixelated, seminal designs.

Tarsila do Amaral,The Moon,"In the 1920s, do Amaral frequently traveled between São Paulo, her native city, and Paris. There, she became acquainted with artists such as Constantin Brancusi and Fernand Léger, and witnessed a variety of avant-garde artistic strategies. In this painting of a moonlit scene, a lonesome cactus resembling a human figure stands in the foreground, contemplatively facing the crescent moon while rooted in an elliptical stream of water—a recurring motif in do Amaral’s compositions from this period. The painting reflects what the artist called her “clean, sharply outlined” technique, while offering an undulating spectacle of a dreamlike quality.

        Additional text






Amaral first showed *A Lua (The Moon)* in Paris, soon after she painted it in 1928. Beginning in 1920, she had traveled frequently between the French capitol and her native Brazil, working in both places. With works like this, she debuted a new style distinct from anything on the Parisian scene: sensuous, highly stylized landscapes and depictions of daily life rendered in a rich palette of saturated color. In this fantastical scene, a lone cactus in the foreground begins to take on the characteristics of a human figure. The wavy curves of a rippling stream, a quarter moon, and an undulating horizon resonate, infusing Amaral’s world with dreamlike qualities.",1928,Oil on canvas,"43 5/16 × 43 5/16"" (110 × 110 cm)",© Tarsila do Amaral,Gift of Joan H.

Walter Niedermayr,Bildraum S 240,"The photographer Walter Niedermayr explores the intersections between natural and constructed landscapes. Using underexposure and desaturation, he creates surreal, light-washed large-format images that are environmental in effect. Since 2000, he has made an ongoing photographic study of the work of SANAA, the contemporary Japanese architectural firm founded by Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa. The triptych Bildraum S 240 features a section of their undulating Rolex Learning Center (200510), a student center on the campus of the École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne).
Taken from within the building, the image emphasizes the structures sculpted concrete floor slab. Its rippled form, which is woven across three frames, suggests an artificial landscape. Niedermayr sees in SANAA's work an affinity with his own, describing the firms attention to architectures sensorial and experiential effects as ""a sort of ambivalence . . . underlined by the use of glass and transparency. In photography, I too try to defy the limit, that of the visible, of representation."" Cropping the buildings boundaries to give it the impression of floating, Bildraum S 240 underscores the tension between the Rolex Learning Centers significant feat of structural engineering and its gravity-defying appearance.

Lygia Clark,Cocoon no. 2,"In 1959, fifteen years after Piet Mondrian’s death, Clark wrote in a letter to him, “If I work, Mondrian, my reason is more than anything to achieve myself in the highest ethical-religious sense. It’s not just to make one surface or another.” That same year, Clark produced Cocoon no. 2, a structure that reflects her intentions to literally and figuratively go beyond the “surface” of geometric abstraction as represented by the paintings of Mondrian. The black trapezoidal plane protrudes from the white diamond-shape backing, thereby entering the viewer’s space. The work is a transitional move toward Clark’s experiments with viewer participation.

Judith Lauand,Concrete 61,"Lauand proclaimed that her work was “based on elements that are inherent to painting itself: form, space, color, and movement. I love synthesis, precision, and exact thinking.” She was the only woman in Grupo Ruptura, a São Paulo–based coterie of Concrete artists, who emphasized rationality and mathematical rigor in their work. Like many Grupo Ruptura members, Lauand leaned heavily on Gestalt theory’s explanation of the mechanics of vision, to create paintings suggestive of movement and three-dimensionality. In this work, black lines painted around a central void appear to rotate like a vortex, while the unframed board seems to float off the wall.

Rhod Rothfuss,Yellow Quadrangle,"“A painting should be something that begins and ends in itself,” Rothfuss wrote. With this cutout frame, the artist put his principle into practice: the yellow rectangle on the left juts out, and the support takes on the shape of the painting itself. While his work was indebted to that of Joaquín Torres-García and to European abstract artists such as Mondrian, Rothfuss was also influenced by vernacular practices. The alkyd resin present in this work was also used by the artist to create floats for carnival parades in his native Montevideo.

Mira Schendel,Untitled,"For Schendel, 1964 was a year of daring artistic experimentation. She oscillated between representation and abstraction and explored new materials, such as rice paper and the red earth of São Paulo, which she mixed with her oil paints. Here, Schendel strips painting of its canvas to expose its coarse wooden stretcher hammered with nails. Crude yet vulnerable, this grid presents itself not as an optical schema but rather as a constructed object with a tactile dimension. The artist noted, “I give the utmost importance to [art] being manual like this, that it be handmade, that it be experienced.”

Jesús Rafael Soto,Double Transparency,"Soto painted striped patterns on two sheets of plexiglass and partially superimposed them so that the composition seems to flicker as you move in front of it. The artist used this optical effect as a way of emphasizing the immaterial and impermanent. “I have never sought to show reality caught at one precise moment,” he explained. “The universe, I believe, is uncertain and unsettled. The same must be true of my work.”

“I really started out with the desire to make the work of Mondrian move,” explained Soto, who had traveled to Holland to see firsthand the work of the Dutch artist. Mondrian’s paintings such as Broadway Boogie-Woogie inspired Soto to animate abstraction by optical means. Using transparent sheets of Plexiglas, he was able to superimpose colorful striations that seem to flicker as the viewer moves. Activating the work through the beholder’s motion became a core principle of Soto’s practice, which over time staged even more complex and immersive bodily encounters.

Paula Modersohn-Becker,Self-Portrait with Two Flowers in Her Raised Left Hand,"In this emblematic self-portrait, the pregnant artist stares at viewers with a steady, compelling gaze. One hand is raised, holding two stylized flowers, while the other rests over her swelling belly. Born in Dresden, Modersohn-Becker studied in Berlin from 1896 to 1898, then moved to Worpswede, an artists’ community north of Bremen. There she met her husband, the artist Otto Modersohn, as well as the poet Rainer Maria Rilke, who became a close companion. Worpswede’s artists were known for their commitment to nature and to positive depictions of the local villagers, but Modersohn-Becker soon grew restless. Between 1900 and her death, in 1907, she made four trips to Paris, studying ancient sculpture and Egyptian mummy portraits at the Louvre and visiting other museums and galleries, all of which profoundly impacted her last great period of work. Best known for penetrating self-portraits, characterized by psychological introspection as well as material and stylistic experimentation, Modersohn-Becker is also thought to be the first woman to paint female nudes.
In this artwork, painted the year of her death, her masklike visage, combined with the areas of thick paint on her brow and right eyelid, the literal carving of a flower into her cheek (likely done with the end of a brush), and the vivid, expressionistic palette, all mark Modersohn-Becker as a pioneering contemporary of Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso.

        Additional text






In this self-portrait, the pregnant artist looks out at us with a steady, self-possessed gaze. She rests one hand protectively on her swelling belly, and raises the other to hold two flowers—symbols of fertility. Modersohn-Becker is believed to have been the first woman to paint herself while pregnant. She was also one of the first German artists to experiment with the audacious color and simplified forms of modernism and to pursue the emotional charge such distortions might provoke. “Personal feeling,” she wrote, “is the main thing.” This was among the last paintings the artist made; she died of complications from childbirth later the same year.

In this emblematic self-portrait, a pregnant Modersohn–Becker stares out at the viewer with a steady, compelling gaze. One hand is raised, holding two stylized flowers, while the other is positioned over her swelling belly. Modersohn–Becker, a pioneering figure of the 20th–century German avant–garde, is believed to be the first woman to paint herself while pregnant; this painting is one of only a few such portrayals. She gave birth to a daughter on November 2, 1907, and died of complications on November 21, at age 31. The painting's audacious palette, stark composition, and psychological depth reflect Modersohn–Becker's position as a pivotal link between Fauvism and German Expressionism.

Barkley L. Hendricks,Sweet Thang (Lynn Jenkins),"Barkley Hendricks is celebrated for the stylish, self-assured portraits he painted of his friends, family, students, and neighborhood acquaintances from the late 1960s through the 1970s. The artist selected subjects who “piqued [his] curiosity . . . by virtue of fashion and personality.” This painting portrays Lynn Jenkins, a student of Hendricks’s at Connecticut College. Jenkins poses on a sofa with calculated nonchalance, her defiant gaze steadily meeting the viewer’s. Her close-to-bursting bubble gum adds a special immediacy and irreverence to the work.

Sibylle Bergemann,"Gummlin, Usedom, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany","In The Monument, Bergemann documents the several phases of the production and installation of the Marx-Engels-Forum monument in East Berlin. Created by the artist Ludwig Engelhardt, the sculpture was intended to express the idea that socialism is something historically German. The pictures resonate with quiet irony: it sometimes appears as though the monument is being dismantled rather than constructed—an allegory for the ultimate fate of the German Democratic Republic.

Barbara Chase-Riboud,The Albino,"Chase-Riboud was nineteen when she created her first lost-wax bronze casting at the American Academy in Rome, establishing a lifelong relationship with both the technique and the city. She began adding fiber to her sculptures a decade later in an attempt to reverse the properties of materials: making metal look soft and delicate and fiber appear ridged and hard. The sculpture may be shown in two configurations: as you see it here (The Albino) or with its arms upstretched to the ceiling (All That Rises Must Converge/Black). Both names have literary resonances. The former is the title of a poem by the artist and the latter is a reference to a 1965 short story about race and class by the Southern writer Flannery O’Connor.

Alice Neel,Georgie Arce,"“I love you Harlem,” Neel wrote in her diary in the early 1940s, “for the rich deep vein of human feeling buried under your fire engines.” Born in Pennsylvania, Neel lived from 1938 to 1962 in Spanish Harlem, where she painted portraits of her friends, family, neighbors, and fellow artists. A chance encounter with a boy named Georgie Arce on a local street sparked a lasting friendship; Neel went on to sketch and paint him several times. Here, she describes him in thick black contours and loose brushstrokes reminiscent of 1920s German Expressionism, an important aesthetic touchstone for her.

Noah Purifoy,Unknown,"As a young artist in Los Angeles, Purifoy was profoundly influenced by the 1965 Watts Rebellion, six days of civil unrest by residents of Watts and other predominantly African American neighborhoods of the city in response to decades of racial injustice. In the event’s aftermath, the artist collected charred debris from the streets and assembled it into a series of sculptures, a technique that would define his practice for years to come. Unknown, though more joyful and playful than Purifoy’s Watts works, is a rare surviving example of his early assemblages. With its easily identifiable castoff objects, it suggests a question central to Purifoy’s practice: “How . . . you tie the art process in with existence.”

Sonja Sekula,The Town of the Poor,"The ghostly scaffolding, swooping calligraphic lines, and blue and yellow washes of this painting most likely depict the view from Sekula’s downtown New York studio, which she shared with composer John Cage and choreographer Merce Cunningham. “Looking outside my window,” wrote this Swiss painter and poet, an immigrant to the United States, “I think of all the contemporary American poets and artists who represent their outlook on this strange country and I find myself beginning to realize that I shall be one of them. I shall begin to speak of . . . a future that we begin to feel underneath the current of war and strife and uncertainty.”

Hervé Télémaque,No Title (The Ugly American),"Télémaque combines historical figures, literary references, and personal imagery. An ancient Venus is portrayed alongside Toussaint Louverture, who led a revolt against slavery and colonial rule in Haiti in the 1790s, and Fidel Castro, the communist leader of the Cuban Revolution. The words at the top left are from Alfred Jarry’s play King Ubu, a satire about a bloodthirsty dictator. Télémaque completed this painting in Paris, where he had moved after becoming disillusioned with New York; the blond heads screaming “STOP,” as well as the work’s pointed title, convey what the artist called the American city’s racist “atmosphere.” These caricatures join other grotesque, cartoon-like imagery in a kaleidoscopic mix that suggests a recurrent history of chaos and senseless violence.

Maren Hassinger,Leaning,"Emerging from Hassinger’s training in fiber arts and longstanding interest in dance, Leaning captures movement in sculptural form, falling somewhere between object-making and performance. “I… began to use the cable in a fiberlike manner,” she recalled. “I bunched it and bound it with wire, then unplied all the strands. I noticed that the material began to resemble living, moving, growing things.” The thirty-two bundles that compose the work give the impression of movement, from the smallest details—the unraveling of the steel rope at the tops and bottoms of each bale—to the way the entire installation seems to sway and bend, as though moved by wind.

Idelle Weber,Untitled,"When Weber first arrived in New York from California in the late 1950s, she was struck by the glass-and-steel skyscrapers then beginning to define the skyline. “I was amazed,” the artist said of the view into these buildings, “because they had fluorescent lights, and men in business suits, but you saw only the silhouettes of these people.” These flattened, faceless figures became an enduring subject of Weber’s work. Focusing on everyday rituals and recognizable types, Weber captured, as one contemporary critic noted, “the attitudes and postures of 20th century man.” Nearly four decades later, her trenchant vision became the basis for the opening credits of the TV series Mad Men.

"Jenny Holzer, Lady Pink",Trust visions that don't feature buckets of blood,"In the 1980s, Holzer and Lady Pink used New York as a backdrop for their artworks: Holzer wheatpasted posters and slogans on walls throughout Manhattan, and Lady Pink spray-painted graffiti on buildings and subway cars. The two also collaborated on a series of paintings on canvas, such as this work, for which Holzer composed phrases and Lady Pink did the painting. Trust visions that don’t feature buckets of blood was based on a recent image by the documentary photographer Susan Meiselas, who worked  extensively in Nicaragua during the armed conflict that roiled the nation for decades in the second half of the twentieth century.

Eduardo Kac,Reabracadabra,"The Movimento de Arte Pornô (Porn Art Movement) was founded in 1980 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. During that time, the group staged pansexual public actions, including nude demonstrations and performances on Rio’s beaches—acts which remain illegal today. They also produced zines and comic books containing poems and detailing the group’s exploits. Following the gang’s dissolution in 1982, one of its founders, Eduardo Kac, turned to nascent cybernetic networks and created poetry for the Minitel, a terminal that connected users as a forerunner of the internet.

Remedios Varo,The Juggler (The Magician),"This painting’s titular juggler (or magician) stands on the platform of a carnivalesque cart filled with fantastical objects and animals. He performs before seemingly identical figures robed in a single gray cloak. To produce this composition, Varo worked in the manner of early Renaissance masters: she transposed preparatory drawings onto a gesso-primed panel which had been scratched to give it texture. She also deployed decalcomania, a technique favored by the Surrealists in which materials such as paper or aluminum foil are pressed onto wet paint to transfer a pattern that may be embellished. Its atmospheric effects can be seen in the magician’s garments and in the background trees.

Petra Cortright,VVEBCAM,"VVEBCAM is a portrait of the artist as a computer user whose primary mode of existence is recording and being watched. Departing from the direct-to-camera address typical of early video art and the ubiquitous selfies of today’s social media, VVEBCAM features Cortright sitting impassively in front of a webcam as she manipulates the clip art moving around her face. The video was made for YouTube, where the artist initially exploited the comments section of the website as much as the video itself, using keywords to attract viewers searching for erotic or offensive content and sabotaging their expectations.

Guadalupe Maravilla,Disease Thrower #5,"Disease Thrower #5 is a sculpture, a shrine, a wearable headdress, and an acoustic instrument. Like all works in the Disease Thrower series, it is, according to the artist, a “healing machine,” which can be activated to create a sound bath with curative potential. It is made from both natural materials, such as straw and loofah, and man-made objects that Maravilla collected while retracing parts of the migratory route from El Salvador to the United States he took as a child. The work also includes anatomical models: one of a breast, another of a malignant tumor.
Disease Thrower #5 es a la vez una escultura, un santuario, un tocado y un instrumento acústico. Como todas las obras de la serie Disease Throwers, se trata, según el artista, de una “máquina sanadora”, que puede activarse para crear un baño de sonido con potencial curativo. Está hecha tanto de materiales orgánicos—por ejemplo, paja y luffa una esponja natural—como de objetos artificiales que Maravilla recolectó mientras volvía a trazar partes de la ruta migratoria que emprendió de niño desde El Salvador hasta los Estados Unidos. La obra también incluye modelos anatómicos: uno de un pecho con un tumor maligno.

Vivian Browne,Little Men #86,"Browne emerged as an artist in New York in the late 1960s, soon becoming an influential figure in circles of Black and feminist artists and activists. These drawings are part of her series of “little men,” which feature ghoulish figures, often aging white men, behaving petulantly. One figure stands stiffly upright, shaking a raised fist; another seems about to liquify. Reflecting on the shocked responses her unflinchingly critical caricatures provoked at the time they were made, Browne said, “people are afraid of the reality. But I think that looking at that should not, perhaps, invoke fear so much as interest, action.”

Pepón Osorio,Badge of Honor,"Badge of Honor emerged from Osorio’s engagement with a neighborhood in Newark, New Jersey, where it was first shown in a storefront. Osorio was concerned to learn that for many young people there, having a parent in jail was considered a badge of honor.
Taking a closer look at the impact of mass incarceration on one family, Osorio filmed a conversation between an incarcerated father at New Jersey’s Northern State Prison and his teenage son at their family home. He traveled back and forth between them over several weeks, sharing footage with each to capture a distanced yet intimate exchange. Here, projections of the father and son face opposite sides of a wall separating two dramatically opposed spaces: a prison cell and a teenager’s bedroom. At one point, notwithstanding the notion of the “badge of honor,” the son declares, “Dad, I would be willing to give up anything for you to just be home with us.”

Shambhavi,Reaper's Melody,"Life on a farm is not idyllic and has never been. Farmers’ lives are governed by a cruel god. We live in a world where development is seen as antithetical to the farmer. Yet it is their labour or love that sustains us. This dichotomy is the reaper’s melody. Discordant and abrasive, yet soothing. It forms the core of artist Shambhavi’s relationship with the world that she expresses here. Her ode to the reaper is abstract, like the tiny hills that divide farm plots, yet literal, in the raw iron sickles of the blacksmith. For the artist Shambhavi, her work is a warning of our times, where the sickle is taken away from the farmer. The sickles standing together, touching each other signify farming as a group activity, central to our existence. As food arrives on our tables in dazzling plastic packages, all of us, including the artist have forgotten the tactile nature of creation. The sickles force us back to our centre.

Christine Sun Kim,The Sound of Temperature Rising,"As our planet warms at a record-breaking pace and catastrophic weather increases, Christine Sun Kim asks, ""What might rising temperatures sound like?"" Kim explores this question using familiar communication systems such as musical scores, graphs, and American Sign Language (ASL), challenging the authority of spoken over signed language. Kim has said of the genesis of this artwork:
""I conceptualized The Sound of Temperature Rising while pregnant with my first child, during a stretch when I felt hot all the time and couldn’t sleep very well. This was also during the rise of Donald Trump and the heated political atmosphere he brought with him. Persistent droughts, floods, and storms were marking the effects of climate change and a warming world. I felt these different kinds of rising temperatures intertwining, and used an open-ended musical notation to capture the feeling. When I draw musical staff lines, I use four lines instead of the standard five, which references how staff bars would be signed in ASL, as four fingers pulled across the front of the body. . . . I want the scale to actively impose Deaf people’s existence and culture into the everyday lives of hearing people.""",2019,Screenprint on wall,,,Fund for the Twenty-First Century,Painting and Sculpture, Floor 1,,https://www.moma.org/media/W1siZiIsIjUxMTU5NCJdLFsicCIsImNvbnZlcnQiLCItcXVhbGl0eSA5MCAtcmVzaXplIDIwMDB4MTQ0MFx1MDAzZSJdXQ.jpg?sha=03f51b2852d105b8,426452,On view
